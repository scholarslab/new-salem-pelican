# ( [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) v. [John Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) )

[April 4, 1692]

1692  Apr. 4. [Abig: Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) complained of [Goodm Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) & cryed out w't are you come to, #[are you come to,] you can pinch as well as your wife & more to that purpose

6. At night she complained of [Goodm: Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) again & beat upon her breast & cryed he pinched her. The like I hear at [Tho. Putmans](/tag/putnam_thomas_jr.html) house.

12 Day, When the Marshall was sent up to enquire of [John Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) & others & I was writing some what thereof as above I met with nothing but interruptions by reason of fits upon [John Indian](/tag/indian_john.html) & [Abigail](/tag/williams_abigail.html) , & [Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) happening to come in just before, they one & another cryed out there is [Goodm: Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) very often: And [Abigail](/tag/williams_abigail.html) said there is [Goodm: Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) in the Majstrats lap, at the same time [Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) was sitting by a knitting we asked her if she saw [Goodm: Proctor](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) (for [Abigail](/tag/williams_abigail.html) was immediately seized with a fit) but she was deaf & dumb, yet still a knitting, then [Mary](/tag/walcott_mary.html) recovered her self & confirmed what [Abigail](/tag/williams_abigail.html) had said that [goodm: proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) she saw in the Majstrats lap Then [John](/tag/proctor_john.html) cryed out to the Dog under the Table to come away for [Goodm: Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) was upon his back, then he cryed out of [Goody Cloyse](/tag/cloyce_sarah.html) , O you old Witch, & fell immediately into a violent fit that 3.men & the Marshall could not without exceeding difficulty hold him: In which fit [Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) that was knitting & well composed said there was [Goodm: Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) & his wife & [Goody Cloyse](/tag/cloyce_sarah.html) helping of him. But so great were the interruptions of [John](/tag/proctor_john.html) & [Abigail](/tag/williams_abigail.html) by fits while we were observing these things to notify them, that we were fain to send them both away that I might have liberty to write this  without disturbance [Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) abiding composed & knitting whilest I was writing & the two other sent away, yet by & by whilst I was writing Mary Walcot said there [Goody Cloyse](/tag/cloyce_sarah.html) has pincht me now

Note.  [Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) never saw [Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) nor his wife till last night coming from the examination at Salem & then she saw [Goody Proctor](/tag/proctor_elizabeth.html) behind her brother Jonathan all the way from the [Widow Gidneys](/tag/gidneys_widow.html) to Phillips where Jonathan made a little stay But this day & time I have been writing this she saw them many times.

Note.  Just now as soon as I had made an end of reading this to the Marshall [Mary W](/tag/warren_mary.html) [Walcott] immediately cryed O yonder is [Good: Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) & his wife & [Goody Nurse](/tag/nurse_rebecca.html) & [Goody Korey](/tag/corey_martha.html) & [G [torn] Cloyse](/tag/cloyce_sarah.html) & Goods Child & then said O [Goodm: Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) is going to choke me & Immediately she was choakt

Munday 11'th mo ditto [Lut. Nath: Ingersoll](/tag/ingersoll_nathaniel.html) Declared that [John Procter](/tag/proctor_john.html) tould [Joseph Pope](/tag/pope_joseph.html) that if hee hade [John Indian](/tag/indian_john.html) in his Costody hee would soone beat the Devell out of him: and so said to severall others

# (Petition of [John Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) from Prison)

[July 23, 1692 ]

Salem-Prison,

July 23, 1692. 

[Mr. Mather,](/tag/mather_increase.html) [Mr. Allen](/tag/allen_john.html) , [Mr. Moody](/tag/moody_daniel.html) , Mr. Willard, and [Mr. Bailey](/tag/bailey_thomas.html).

Reverend Gentlemen.

The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our Judges, and Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn, having Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and engaged against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your Favourable Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it be possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates, Ministers, Jewries, and all the People in general, being so much inraged and incensed against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no other, by reason we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent Persons. Here are five Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along with them at a Sacrament, since we were committed into close Prison, which we know to be Lies. Two of the 5 are (Carriers Sons) Youngmen, who would not confess any thing till they tyed them Neck and Heels till the Blood was ready to come out of their Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of making them confess that they never did, by reason they said one had been a  Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their Mother had made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son [William Procter](/tag/proctor_william.html) , when he was examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty, when he was Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out at his Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions are very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our Estates, and that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods. If it cannot be granted that we can have our Trials at Boston, we humbly beg that you would endeavour to have these Magistrates changed, and others in their rooms, begging also and beseeching you would be pleased to be here, if not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of saving the sheeding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your Prayers to the Lord in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants,
[JOHN PROCTER](/tag/proctor_john.html) , etc. ( Robert Calef , More Wonders of The Invisible World [ London, 1700 ], excerpted in Burr, ed. , Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases, pp. 362-364 .)
