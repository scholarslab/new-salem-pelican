# (Examination of [Martha Corey](/tag/corey_martha.html) )

[March 21, 1692 ]

21 March 1691/2

[Mr Hathorne.](/tag/hathorn_john.html)

You are now in the hands of Authority tell me now  why you hurt these persons

[Martha Kory.](/tag/corey_martha.html)

I do not. 

who doth? 

Pray give me leave to goe to prayer 

This request was made sundry times 

We do not send for you to go to prayer But tell me  why you hurt these?

I am an innocent person: I never had to do with 

Witchcraft since I was born. I am a Gospel Woman 

Do not you see these complain of you 

The Lord open the eyes of the Magistrates & Ministers:  the Lord show his power to discover the guilty.

Tell us who hurts these children. 

I do not know. 

If you be guilty of this fact do you think you can  hide it.

The Lord knows -- 

Well tell us w't you know of this matter 

Why I am a Gosple-woman, & do you think I can have  to do with witchcraft too

How could you tell then that the Child was bid to  observe what cloths you wore when some came to  speak w'th you.

[Cheevers.](/tag/cheever_ezekiel.html)

Interrupted her & bid her not begin with a lye  & so [Edw'd Putman](/tag/putnam_edward.html) declared the matter

[Mr Hath:](/tag/hathorn_john.html)

Who told you that 

[K.](/tag/corey_martha.html)

He said the child said 

[Cheev:](/tag/cheever_ezekiel.html)

you speak falsly 

Then [Edw: Putman](/tag/putnam_edward.html) read again

[Mr H.](/tag/hathorn_john.html)

Why did you ask if the child told w't cloths you wore 

My husband told me the others told 

Who told you about the cloaths? Why did you ask  that question.

Because I heard the children told w't cloaths the  other wore

[Goodm: Kory](/tag/corey_giles.html) did you tell her

The old man denyed that he told her so. 

Did you not say your husband told you so 

[K.](/tag/corey_martha.html)

-- 

[H.](/tag/hathorn_john.html)

Who hurtes these children now look upon them. 

[K.](/tag/corey_martha.html)

I cannot help it 

[H.](/tag/hathorn_john.html)

Did you not say you would tell the truth why you  askt that question: how come you to the knowledge --

I did but ask 

You dare thus to lye in all this assembly You are now  before Authority. I expect the truth, you promised it,  Speak now & tell#[what cloths] who told you what  cloths

[K.](/tag/corey_martha.html)

No body 

[H.](/tag/hathorn_john.html)

How came you to know that the children would be  examined what cloth you wore

Because I thought the child was wiser, than any body  if she knew

Give an answer you said your husband told you 

He told me the children said I afflicted them 

How do you know w't they came for, answer me this  truly,

# 

will you say how you came to know what they came  for

I had heard speech that the children said I #[afflicted  them] troubled them & I thought that they might  come to examine

But how did you know it 

I thought they did 

Did not you say you would tell the truth, who told  you w't they came for

No body 

How did you know 

I did think so 

But you said you knew so 

Child:  H Q

There is a man whispering in her ear, 

What did he say to you. 

We must not beleive all that these distracted children  say

Cannot #[he tell] you tell what that man whispered 

I saw no body 

But did not you hear 

No, here was Extream agony of all the afflicted 

If you expect mercy of God, you must look for it in  Gods way by confession

Do you think to find mercy by aggravating your sins 

A true thing 

Look for it then in Gods way 

# 

So I do 

Give glory to God & confess then 

But I cannot confess 

Do not you see how these afflicted do charge you 

We must not beleive distracted persons 

Who do you improve to hurt them 

I improved none 

Did not you say our eyes were blinded you would  open them

Yes to accuse the innocent 

Then Crossly gave in evidence 

Why cannot the girl stand before you 

I do not know. 

What did you mean by that 

I saw them fall down 

It seems to be an insulting speech as if they could  not stand before you.

They cannot stand before others. 

But you said they cannot stand before you 

Tell me what was that turning upon the Spit by you 

You beleive the Children that are distracted I saw no  spit

Here are more than two that accuse you for witchcraft 

What do you say 

I am innocent 

Then [mr Hathorn](/tag/hathorn_john.html) read farther of Croslys evidence

What did you mean by that the Devil could not stand  before you

She denyed it 

3. or 4. Sober witnesses confirm'd it. 

What can I do many rise up against me 

Why confess. 

So I would if I were guilty 

Here are sober persons what do you say to them 

You are a Gosple woman, will you lye 

Abigail cryed out next Sab: is sacrament day, but she  shall not come there

[Kory](/tag/corey_martha.html)

I do not care 

You charge these children with distraction: it is a note  of distraction when persons vary in a minute, but  these fix upon you, this is not the manner of dis-  traction --

When all are against me w't can I help it 

Now tell me the truth will you, why did you say that  the Magistrates & Ministers eyes are blinded you would  open them

She laught & denyed it. 

Now tell  us how we shall know

Who doth hurt these if you do not 

Can an innocent person be guilty 

Do you deny these words 

Yes 

Tell us who hurts these: We came to be a Terror to  evil doers

You say you would open our eyes we are blind 

If you say I am a Witch 

You said you would show us 

She denyed it. 

Why do you not now show us 

I cannot tell: I do not know 

What did you strike the maid at [Mr Tho: Putmans](/tag/putnam_thomas_jr.html) with

I never struck her in my life 

Here are two that see you strike her with an iron rod. 

I had no hand in it 

Who had 

Do you beleive these children are bewitcht

They may for ought I know I have no hand in it. 

You say you are no Witch, may be you mean you  never Covenanted with the Devil. Did you never deal  w'th any familiar

No never 

What bird was that the children spoke of 

Then Witnesses, spoke 

What bird was it. 

I know no bird. 

It may be: you have engaged you will not confess. but  God knows.

So he doth 

Do you beleive you shall go unpunished 

I have nothing to do w'th withcraft

Why was you not willing your husband should come  to the former Session here

But he came for all 

Did not you take the Saddle off 

I did not know what it was for 

Did you not know w't it was for 

I did not know that it would be to any benefit 

Some body said that she would not have them help to  find out witches.

Did you not say you would open our eyes why do  you not

I never thought of a Witch 

Is it a laughing matter to see these afflicted persons 

She denyed it 

Severall prove it 

Ye are all against me & I cannot help it 

Do not you beleive there are Witches in the Countrey 

I do not know that there is any 

Do not you know that [Tituba](/tag/tituba.html) Confessed it

I did not hear  her speak

I find you will own nothing without severall witnesses  & yet you will deny for all

It was noted w'n she bit her lip severall of the afflic-  ted were bitten

When she was urged upon it that she bit her lip saith  she what harm is there in it.

[Mr. Noyes](/tag/noyes_nicholas.html) .

I beleive it is apparent she practiseth Witchcraft in  the congregation there is no need of images

What do you say to all these thing that are apparent 

If you will all go hang me how can I help it. 

Were you to serve the Devil ten years tell how many 

She laught 

The Children cryed there was a yellow bird with her 

When [Mr Hathorn](/tag/hathorn_john.html) askt her about it she laught

When her hands were at liberty the afflicted persons  were pincht

Why do not you tell how the Devil comes in your  shape & hurts these; you said you would

How can I know how 

Why did you say you would show us 

She laught again 

What book is that you would have these children  write in

What book: were should I have a book I showed them  none, nor have none nor brought none.

The afflicted cryed out there was a man whispering in  her ears.

What book did you carry to [Mary Walcott](/tag/walcott_mary.html)

I carryed none: if the Devil appears in my shape 

Then [Needham](/tag/needham.html) Said that Parker some time agoe  thought this woman was a Witch

Who is your God 

The God that made me 

Who is that God 

The God that made me 

What is his name 

Jehova 

Do you know any other name 

God Almighty 

Doth he tell you that you pray to that he is God 

Almighty 

Who do I worship but the God that made [me] 

How many Gods are there 

One 

How many persons

Cannot you say so there is one God in three blessed  persons

(then she was troubled) 

Do not you see these children & women are rational  & sober as their neighbours when your hands are  fastened Immediately they were seized with fitts  & the standers by

# (Examination of [Martha Corey](/tag/corey_martha.html), as Told by Deodat Lawson)

[March 21, 1692]

On Monday the 21st of March, The Magistrates of Salem appointed to come to Examination of Goodw C. And about twelve of the Clock, they went into the Meeting-House, which was Thronged with Spectators: Mr. Noyes began with a very pertinent and pathetic_?_l Prayer; and Goodwife C. being called to answer to what was Alledged against her, she desired to go to Prayer, which was much wondred at, in the presence of so many hundred people: The Magistrates told her, they would not admit it; they came not there to hear her Pray, but to Examine her, in what was Alledged against her. The Worshipful Mr. Hathorne, asked her, Why she Afflicted those Children! she said, she did not Afflict them. He asked her, who did then? she said, I do not know; How should I know? The Number of the Afflicted Persons were about that time Ten, viz. Four Married Women, Mrs Pope, Mrs. Putman, Goodw. Bibber, and an Ancient Woman, named Goodall, three Maids, Mary Walcut, Mercy Lewes, at Thomas Putman’s, and a Maid at Dr. Griggs’s, there were three Girls from 9 to 12 Years of Age, each of them, or thereabouts, viz. Elizabeth Parris, Abigail Williams and Ann Putman; these were most of them at G. C’s Examination, and did vehemently accuse her in the Assembly of afflicting them, by Biting, Pinching, Strangling, &c. And that they did in their Fit, see her Likeness coming to them, and bringing a Book to them, she said, she had no Book; they affirmed, she had a Yellow-Bird, that used to suck betwixt her Fingers, and being asked about it, if she had any Familiar Spirit, that attended her, she said, She had no Familiarity with any such thing- She was a Gospel Woman: which Title she called her self by; and the Afflicted Persons told her, ah! She was, A Gospel Witch. Ann Putman did there affirm, that one day when Lieutenant Fuller was at Prayer at her Fathers House, she saw the shape of Goodw. C. and she thought Goodw. N. Praying at the same time to the Devil, she was not sure it was Goodw. N. she thought it was; but very sure she saw the Shape of G. C. The said C. said, they were poor, distracted Children, and no heed to be given to what they said. Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Noyes replyed, it was the judgment of all that were present, they were Bewitched, and only she the Accused Person said, they were Distracted. It was observed several times, that if she did but bite her Under lip in time of Examination the persons afflicted were bitten on their armes and wrists and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, Ministers and others. And being watched for that, if she did but Pinch her Fingers, or Graspe one Hand, hard in another, they were Pinched and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, and Spectators. After that, it was observed, that if she did but lean her Breast, against the Seat, in the Meeting House, (being the Barr at which she stood,) they were afflicted. Particularly Mrs. Pope complained of grievous torment in her Bowels as if they were torn out. She vehemently accused said C. as the instrument, and first threw her Muff at her; but that flying not home, she got off her Shoe, and hit Goodwife C. on the head with it. After these postures were watched, if said C. did but stir her feet, they were afflicted in their Feet, and stamped fearfully. The afflicted persons asked her why she did not go to the company of Witches which were before the Meeting house mustering? Did she not hear the Drum beat? They accused her of having Familiarity with the Devil, in the time of Examination, in the shape of a Black man whispering in her ear; they affirmed, that her Yellow-Bird, sucked betwixt her Fingers in the Assembly; and order being given to see if there were any sign, the Girl that saw it, said, it was too late now; she had removed a Pin, and put it on her head; which was found there sticking upright. They told her, she had Covenanted with the Devil for ten years, six of them were gone, and four more to come. She was required by the Magistrates to answer that Question in the Catechism, How many persons be there in the God-Head? she answered it but oddly, yet was there no great thing to be gathered from it; she denied all that was charged upon her, and said, They could not prove a Witch; she was that Afternoon Committed to Salem-Prison; and after she was in Custody, she did not so appear to them, and afflict them as before.

[September 8, 1692]

The deposition of [Edward Putnum](/tag/putnam_edward.html) aged about 36 years and [Eze- kiel Cheever](/tag/cheever_ezekiel.html) aged about 37 years testifieth and sayeth that wee being  often complained unto by [An Putnum](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) that [goode Corie](/tag/corey_martha.html) did often  appear to her and tortor her by pinching and other wayes thought  it our duty to goe to her and see what shee would say to this com-  plaint shee being in church covenant with us.

and accordingly upon the 12'th day of march about ten of the  clock we appointed to goe about the midle afternoon, and wee de-  sired [An Putnam](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) to take good notice of what cloathes [goode Corie](/tag/corey_martha.html)  came in that so we might see whither shee was not mistaken in the  person, and accordingly wee went to the house of [Thomas Putnum](/tag/putnam_thomas_jr.html)   before we went to [goode Corie](/tag/corey_martha.html) to see what [An](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) could say about  her cloathes. and shee told us that presently after we had #[spoken]  told her that we would goe and talke with [goode Corie](/tag/corey_martha.html) shee came  and blinded her but told her that her name was [Corie](/tag/corey_martha.html) and that shee  should see her no more before it was night because she should not  tell us what cloathes shee had on and then shee would come again  and pay her off.

then wee went both of us away from the house of [Thomas Put- num](/tag/putnam_thomas_jr.html) to the house of [Giles Corie](/tag/corey_giles.html) where we found go the abovesaid  Corie all alone in her house and as soone as we came in. in a smil-  ing manner shee sayeth I know what you are come for you are come  to talke with me about being a witch but I am none I cannot helpe  peoples talking of me [Edward Putnum](/tag/putnam_edward.html) answered her that it was the  afflicted person that did complain of her that was the occasion of  our coming to her. she presently replied but does shee tell you what  cloathes I have on we made her no answer to this at her first asking  where upon shee asked us again with very great eagernes but does  she tell you what cloathes I have on at which questions with that  eagernes of mind. with which shee did aske made us to thinke of  what [An Putnum](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) had told us before wee went to her. #[to which]  and wee told her no shee did not for shee told us that you came and  blinded her and told her that shee should see you no more before  it was night that so shee might not tell us what cloathes you had  on. shee made but litle answer to this but seemed to smile at it as  if shee had showed us a pretty trick

we had a great deal of talke with her about the complaint that was  of her and how greatly the name of God and religion and thee  church was dishonured by this meanes but shee seemed to be no  way conserned for any thing about it but only to stop the mouthes  of people that they might not say thus of her shee told us that shee did  not thinke that they were accused for shee said if they were wee  could not blame the devill for making witches of them for they were  idle sloathfull persons and minded nothing that was good. but we  had no reason to thinke so of her for shee had made a profession of  christ and rejoyced to go and hear the word of god and the like.  but we told her it was not her making an out ward profession that  would clear her from being a witch for it had often been so in the  wourld that witches had crept into the churches: much more dis-  course we had with her but shee made her profession a cloake to   cover all she furder told us that the devill was come down amongst  us in great rage and that God had forsaken the earth. and after much  discourse with her being to much here to be related we returned to  the house of the above said [Thomas Putnum](/tag/putnam_thomas_jr.html) and we found that shee  had done as shee said shee would for shee came not to hurt the above  said Putnum as #[shee] [Ann Putnam](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) told us all this time but after  we were gone we understand that shee came again as shee did use to  doe before greatly afflicting of her

we doe furder testifie that upon her examination shee accordeng to  what was said of her that shee would open thee eyes of the magis-  trates and ministers. so shee did for shee made a most clear discovery  witchcraft for by biting her lip it was observed that the afflicted #  [children] persons were bit when that was discovered then we ob-  served that shee would #[pinch] pinch them by niping her fingers  togeather and when that was discovered and her hands held then  shee afflict them by working with her foot and when that was dis-  covered then shee pressed upon the seate with her breast and [mistress Pope](/tag/pope_bathshua.html) was greatly afflicted by great pressure upon her stomack
