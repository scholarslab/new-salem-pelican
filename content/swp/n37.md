# (The Examination of Giles Cory)

[April 19, 1692 ]

The examination of [GILES CORY](/tag/corey_giles.html), at a Court at Salem Village, held by [John Hathorn](/tag/hathorn_john.html) and [Jona. Curwin](/tag/corwin_jonathan.html), Esqrs. April 19, 1692.  
[Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html), you are brought before authority upon high suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft; now tell us the truth in this matter.

I hope through the goodness of God I shall, for that matter I never had no hand in, in my life. Which of you have seen this man hurt you? [Mary Wolcott](/tag/walcott_mary.html), [Mercy Lewis](/tag/lewis_mercy.html), [Ann Putnam, jr.](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) and [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) affirmed he had hurt them

Hath he hurt you too? speaking to [Elizabeth Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html). She going to answer was prevented by a fit. [Benjamin Gold](/tag/gould_benjamin.html), hath he hurt you? I have seen him several times, and been hurt after it, but cannot affirm that it was he. Hath he brought the book to any of you? [Mary Wolcott](/tag/walcott_mary.html) and [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) and others affirmed he had brought the book to them.

[Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html), they accuse you, or your appearance, of hurting them, and bringing the book to them. What do you say? Why do you hurt them? Tell us the truth. I never did hurt them. It is your appearance hurts them, they charge you; tell us what you have done. I have done nothing to damage them.

Have you ever entered into contract with the devil? I never did. What temptations have you had? I never had temptations in my life. What, have you done it without temptations?

What was the reason (said [goodwife Bibber](/tag/bibber_sara.html)) that you were frighted in the cow-house? and then the questionist was suddenly seized with a violent fit.

[Samuel Braybrook](/tag/braybrook_samuel.html), [goodman Bibber](/tag/bibber_john.html), and his daughter, testified that he had told them this morning that he was frighted in the cow-house. [Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) denied it. This was not your appearance but your person, and you told them so this morning: why do you deny it? What did you see in the cow-house? I never saw nothing but my cattle. Divers witnessed that he told them he was frighted. Well, what do you say to these witnesses? What was it frighted you? I do not know that ever I spoke the word in my life. Tell the truth, what was it frighted you? I do not know any thing that frighted me.

All the afflicted were seized now with fits, and troubled with pinches. Then the court ordered his hands to be tied. What, is it not enough to act witchcraft at other times, but must you do it now in the face of authority? I am a poor creature, and cannot help it. Upon the motion of his head again, they had their heads and necks afflicted.

Why do you tell such wicked lies against witnesses, that heard you speak after this manner, this very morning? I never saw any thing but a black hog. You said that you were stopt once in prayer; what stopt you? I cannot tell; my wife came towards me and found fault with me for saying living to God and dying to sin.

What was it frighted you in the barn? I know nothing frighted me there. Why here are three witnesses that heard you say so to-day. I do not remember it.

[Thomas Gold](/tag/gould_thomas_sr.html) testified that he heard him say, that he knew enough against his wife, that would do her business. What was it that you knew against your wife? Why that of living to God, and dying to sin. The Marshal and Bibber's daughter confirmed the same, that he said he could say that that would do his wife's business.

I have said what I can say to that. What was that about your ox? I thought he was hipt.

What ointment was that your wife had when she was seized? You said it was ointment she made by [major Gidney's](/tag/gidney_bartholomew.html) direction. He denied it, and said she had it of [goody Bibber](/tag/bibber_sara.html), or from her direction. [Goody Bibber](/tag/bibber_sara.html) said it is not like that ointment. You said you knew, upon your own knowledge, that she had it of [major Gidney](/tag/gidney_bartholomew.html). He denied it.

Did not you say, when you went to the ferry with your wife, you would not go over to Boston now, for you should come yourself the next week? I would not go over, because I had not money. The Marshal testified he said as before.

One of his hands was let go, and several were afflicted. He held his head on one side, and then the heads of seve- ral of the afflicted were held on one side. He drew in his cheeks, and the cheeks of some of the afflicted were suckt in.

[John Bibber](/tag/bibber_john.html) and his [wife](/tag/bibber_sara.html) gave testimony concerning some temptations he had to make away with himself. How doth this agree with what you said, that you had no temptations? I meant temptation to witchcraft. If you can give away to self murther, that will make way to temptation to witchcraft.

Note. There was witness by several, that he said he would make away with himself, and charge his death up- on his son. [Goody Bibber](/tag/bibber_sara.html) testified that the said [Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) called said Bibber's husband, damn'd, devilish rogue. Other vile expressions testified in open court by several others.  
                                                                       Salem Village, April 19, 1692. 

[Mr. Samuel Parris](/tag/parris_samuel.html) being desired to take in writing the examination of [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html), delivered it in; and upon hearing the same, and seeing what we did see at the time of his examination, together with the charge of the afflicted persons against him, we committed him to their majesties' gaol.  
                                                                        [John Hathorn](/tag/hathorn_john.html).

# (Letter from [Thomas Putnam](/tag/putnam_thomas_jr.html) to Judge [Samuel Sewall](/tag/sewall_stephen.html), an "Extract")

The Last Night my Daughter [Ann](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) was grievously Tormented by Witches, Threatning that she should be Pressed to Death, before [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) . But thro' the Goodness of a Gracious God, she had at last a  little Respite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a man in a Winding Sheet; who told her that [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) had Murdered him, by Pressing him to Death with his Feet; but that the Devil there  appeared unto him, and Covenented with him, and promised him, He should not be Hanged. The Apparition said, God Hardened his  Heart, that he should not hearken to the Advice of the Court, and so  Dy an easy Death; because as it said, “It must be done to him as he  has done to me.” The Apparition also said, That [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) was  Carry'd to the Court for this, and that the Jury had found the  Murder, and that her Father knew the man, and the thing was done before she was born. Now Sir, This is not a little strange to us; that no body should Remember these things, all the while that [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) was in Prison, and so often before the Court. For all people now Remember very well, (and the Records of the Court also mention it,) That about Seventeen Years ago, [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) kept a man  in his House, that was almost a Natural Fool: which Man Dy'd suddenly. A Jury was Impannel'd upon him, among whom was [Dr. Zorobbabel Endicot](/tag/endicott_zerubable.html) ; who found the man bruised to Death, and having clodders of Blood about his Heart. The Jury, whereof several are yet alive, brought in the man Murdered; but as if some Enchantment had hindred the Prosecution of the Matter, the Court  Proceeded not against [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) , tho' it cost him a great deal of Mony to get off.
