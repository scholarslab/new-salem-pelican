# (Petition of [Samuel Wardwell Jr.](/tag/wardwell_samuel_jr.html) for Reversing Attainder, and for and Restitution for [Sarah Wardwell](/tag/wardwell_sarah.html))

[February 19, 1711]

To the honourable, the Gentlemen of the Committee Sitting at Salem Feb. 19.  
1711/12

Whereas my mother [Sarah Wardel](/tag/wardwell_sarah.html) was condemned by the Court at Salem sometime in January in the year 1692, as I Suppose will appear by the Records of thes Tryalls at that  
Court, but her name is not inserted in the late Act of the General Court, for the taking off  
the Attainder of those that were condemned #[for] in that year, my mother being since  
deceased, I thought it my duty to Endeauour that her Name may have the benefit of that  
Act. I therefore humbly pray your Honours to Represent this case to the Honourable Gen'll  
Court, that my mothers name may be inserted in the Said Act. And whereas in the Account  
which I gave to your Honor's, when you met at Salem the Last winter, I mentioned only  
what was Seized of my Fathers Estate by the Sherriffe, but gave no account of other charges  
which did arise from the imprisonment of my Father and mother, they having provided for  
their own subsistence while they were in Prison, and I Suppose #[they] there was Something  
considerable payd to the keeper of the prison, though I am not able now to give a particular  
account how much it was. If your Honours please to allow me something upon that account  
It will be thankfully acknowledged by.

your honour's  
most humble servant
