Being asked whether she was sister to [John Soams](/tag/somes_john.html) she answered peremptorily she would not tell, for all was false that [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) said. furthermore [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) affirmed that she told her, that she viz the s'd [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) was the Instrumental Means of the death of Southwick, Upon which s'd [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) casting her Eye on [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) struck her into a dreadful fitt, and bitt her so dreadfully, that the Like was never seen on any of the aflicted, which the s'd [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) Charged the s'd[Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) with doeing off, saying that the s'd [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) told her this day she would be the death of her. further Warren Affirms  that she the s'd [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) ran two pinns into her side this day, which being plucked out the blood ran out after them. [Goody Gaskin](/tag/gaskin_goody.html) being present att this Examination affirmed she had kept her Bed for most parts these thirteen months--[Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) further affirms she told her that when she did goe abroad att any time it was in the Night which [Goody Gaskin](/tag/gaskin_goody.html) being present Confirmed the same, that that was the Usual time off her goeing abroad -- furthermore [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) affirmed that this [Abigail Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) would have had her to have made a bargain with her, telling her if she would not tel of her being a sickly woman, she would not afflict her any more, and that then she should goe along with her, for the s'd [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) told her, she was her God, Upon w'ch [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) answered she would not keep the Devils Councel. Soams told her she was not a Devil but she was her God. After this appearing three times more to her, she s'd att one of those times she was as good as a God. Q. [Mary Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) is this true? A. It is nothing but the truth. [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) being asked who hurt [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) in the time of her fits she Answered it was the Enemy hurt her. I have been said she myself distracted many a time, and my senses have gone from mee, and I thought I have seen many a Body hurt mee, and might have accused many as well as she doth. I Really thought I had seen many persons att my Mothers house at Glocester, and they greatly aflicted me as I thought: [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) being Commanded while [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) was in a dreadful fit, to take [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) by the hand, the said [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) immediately recovered;  this Experiment was tried three times over and the Issue the same. [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) after a Recovery being commanded to touch the s'd [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) although she assayed several times to do it with great Earnestness she was not able, But fell down into a dreadful fit, Upon which the s'd [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) being Commanded take [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) by the hand, she immediately recovered her again, [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) affirming she felt something soft in her hand, (her Eyes then being first shut) which revived her very heart. [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) being asked what the Reason was she could not Come to touch [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) affirmed she saw the apparition of [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) come from her Body, and would meet her, and thrust her with Violence back again, not suffring her to Come near her -- sometimes [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) would say it was distraction in talking she would often Laugh, upon which Laughing the aflicted person would presently fal into a fit. [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) being asked whether she thought this was witchcraft, or whether there were any Witches in the world, answered she did not know any thing but said itt was the Enemy or some Other wicked person or the Enemy himself that forces persons to afflict her att this time, presently this Warren fell into a trance, comeing out of which she affirmed, that, [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) told her in the time of her trance that she would thrust an Awl into her very heart and would kil her this night. [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) could never cast her Eye upon [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html), but immediately she struck her down, and one time she affirmed s'd [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) struck her such a Blow as almost killed, which made the s'd [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) break out into abundance of tears. [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) being Charged with it, instead of bewailing itt, Broke forth into Laughter. [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) being also afflicted by the wringing of her mouth after a strange, and prodigious manner, [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) being Command'd to look upon her in that fit, peremptorily answered she would not, same being by being ordered to turn her face about to look on the afflicted, which being accordingly done, she shut her Eyes Close, and would not look on her being then ordered to touch her she did and immediately [Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) Recovered, which no sooner done but Soams opened her Eyes and looked on the afflicted, and struck her into another most dreadful and terrible fit, and in this manner she practised her Witchcrafts severall times before the Court. [Mary Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) Looking on her affirmed this to be the very woman that had so often afflicted her dureing the Examination and Charged her with it to her face. sometimes dureing the Examination [Soams](/tag/somes_abigail.html) would put her oun foot behind her Other leg, and immediately [Warrens](/tag/warren_mary.html) Legs would be twisted
