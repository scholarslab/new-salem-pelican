# ( [Rev. Increase Mather's](/tag/mather_increase.html) Report of his Conversation in Prison with [Mary Bridges, Sr.](/tag/bridges_mary_sr.html) )

[October 19, 1692 ]

[Goodwife Bridges](/tag/bridges_mary_sr.html) said that she had confessed against herself things which were all utterly false; and that she was brought to her confession by being told that she certainly was a witch, and so made to believe it, -- though she had no other grounds so to believe.

( Charles W. Upham, Salem Witchcraft. Boston, 1867, II, 406 .)
