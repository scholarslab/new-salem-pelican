I [John Hale](/tag/haljoh.html) of Beverly aged 56 years beeing su[mbar ]oned to appeare & give evidence against [Sarah Wiles](/tag/wilsar.html) of Topsfeild July .2. 1692;  Testify that about 15 or 16 yeares agoe came to my house the wife of [John Hirrek](/tag/herjoh.html) of Beverly w'th an aged woeman she said was her mother [Goody Reddington](/tag/redmar.html) of Topsfeild come to me for counsel beeing in trouble of spirit. when the said [Reddington](/tag/redmar.html) opned her greifs to me this was one that she was assaulted by witchcraft that [Goody wiles](/tag/wilsar.html) her neighb'r bewitched her & afflicted her many times greiviously, telling me many particular storys how & when she troubled her, w'ch I have forgotten. She said allso that a son in law of said [Wiles](/tag/wilsar.html) did come & visit her (shee called him an honest young man named John as I take it) & did pitty her the said [Reddington](/tag/redmar.html), signifying to her that he beleived his mother wiles was a witch & told her storys of his mother. I allso understood by them, that this [Goody Wiles](/tag/wilsar.html) was mother in law to a youth named as I take it [Jonathan Wiles](/tag/wiljoh1.html) who about twenty yeares agoe or more did act or was acted very strangly Insomuch that I was invited to joyn with Mr Cobbet  & others at Ipswich to advize & pray for the said Youth; whome some thought to counterfeit, others to be possessed by the devill. But I remember Mr Cobbet thought he was under Obsession of the devil. [Goody Reddingtons](/tag/redmar.html) discourse hath caused me to have farther #(thoug) thoughts of the said Youths case whether he were not bewitched.

att last one of our wheales fell in up to the stock altho the meadow was feirme: then we threw almost all the hay from ofe our cart and thought to trie to git out the cart with sum hay upon it but we could not. then we said one to another. it was in vain to strive for we thought [gooddy willes](/tag/wilsar.html) was in the cart. and then we threw of all the hay and then we tried to make our oxen draw out the emty cart which at first they could not doe: but att last the whele jumpt up at once we knew not how almost redy to thro down our oxen on their #(heads) knees then againe we loaded up our load of hay very well and bound it: and away wee went with it very well tell we came near to a very dangerous hill to goe down with a load of hay: and then I the said [Joseph Andrew](/tag/andjos.html) was by the foremost oxen and saw sumthing about as bigge as a dogge glance from a stump or root of a tree along by me and the oxen and the oxen began to jump: but I could not sti#(u)re from the place for I know not how long: and I the said [John Andrew](/tag/andjoh2.html) being by the hindmost oxen saw nothing but the oxen begining to jump I cast [caught] hold of one of the oxen bowes & as was caried down viollently that dangerouse hill I know not how: where was a brooke at the bottom of it with a bridge and a ford: and the oxen ran into the ford and over thrue the load of hay their: and when I came to To understand where I was and saw the oxen ware all well I began to bethinke my self of my Brother [Joseph:](/tag/andjos.html) and Immediatly called him but he gave no answer. and I began to be trobled for him and went backward towards the place where the oxen were affrighted and I called severall times but he gave me no answer at last I called and said the load is overthron then immediatly he answered me and came unto me: but how the load should keep upon the wheles runing so violently down that dangerous hill: #(?) & being over throne whare it was we can give no account unles it was don by summ diabolicall  art: then againe we gott up our cart and loaded up our hay very firme resolving to gitt hom our load if we could tho it was night: and when we had loaded we went to bind our load: but by all the skill [and] strenth we had we could now wayes bind our load with our cart rope but it would hang lose on our load: however we went away whom with our load and it laid very well for all it was night and our load unbound: also before we got whom many of our friends and neighbors meet us being consarned for us because we ware so latte & they also saw our cart Rope hang lose and tould us of it. and wee tould them what mishap we had that day: and they also tried to fasten the Rope but could not: all which made us then to think and ever sence have thought: and still doe thinke that [Gooddy willes](/tag/wilsar.html) who #(had) now stands Charged with High suspition of severall acts of wicthcraft had a hand in our Mishap at that time#(?).
