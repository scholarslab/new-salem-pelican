She said allso that a son in law of said [Wiles](/tag/wilds_sarah.html) did come & visit her (shee called him an honest young man named John as I take it) & did pitty her the said [Reddington](/tag/reddington_margaret.html), signifying to her that he beleived his mother [wiles](/tag/wilds_sarah.html) was a witch & told her storys of his mother.

But I remember Mr Cobbet thought he was under Obsession of the devil. [Goody Reddingtons](/tag/reddington_margaret.html) discourse hath caused me to have farther #(thoug) thoughts of the said Youths case whether he were not bewitched.
