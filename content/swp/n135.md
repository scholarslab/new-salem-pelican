# (Examination of [Mary Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html))

[April 19, 1692]

The examintion of [Mary Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html)  
At a Court in Salem Village  
[John Hauthorne](/tag/hathorn_john.html) ] Esq'rs  
[Jonath: Corwin](/tag/corwin_jonathan.html) ] Esq'rs

As soon as she was coming towards the Bar the afflicted fell into fits.  
[Mary Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html), You stand here charged with sundry acts of Witchcraft, what do you say for your self, are you guilty, or not?

I am inocent. 

Hath she hurt you (speaking to the sufferers) Some were Dumb. [Betty Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html) testifyed ag'st her, & then said [Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html) fell into a violent fit.

You were a little while ago an Afflicted person, now you are an Afflicter: How comes this to pass? 

I looke up to God & take it to be a great Mercy of God. 

What do you take it to be a great mercy to afflict others? 

[Betty Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html) testifyed that a little after this [Mary](/tag/warren_mary.html) was well, she the said [Mary](/tag/warren_mary.html), said that the afflicted persons did but dissemble.

Now they were all but [John Indian](/tag/indian_john.html) grievously afflicted, & [M'rs Pope](/tag/pope_bathshua.html) also, who was not afflicted before hitherto this day: & after a few moments [John Indian](/tag/indian_john.html) fell into a violent fit also.

Well here was one just now that was a Tormentor in her apparition, & she owns that she had made a league with the Devil.  
Now [Mary Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) fell into a fit, & some of the afflicted cryed out that she was going to confess, but [Goody Korey](/tag/corey_martha.html) , & [Procter](/tag/proctor_john.html) , & his wife came in, in their apparition, & struck her down, & said she should tell nothing.

[Mary Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) continued a good space in a fit, #(the) that she did neither see, nor hear, nor speak.  
Afterwards she started up, & said I will speak & cryed out, Oh! I am sorry for it, I am sorry for it, & wringed her hands, & fell a little while into a fit again: & then came to speak, but immediately her Teeth were set, & then she fell into a voilet fit, & cryed out, Oh Lord help me, Oh good Lord save me! 

And then afterwards cryed again, I will tell, I will tell, & then fell into a dead fit againe. 

And afterwards cryed, I will tell, they did, they did, they did, & then fell into a violent fit again. 

After a little recovery she cryed I will tell, I will tell, they brought me me to it; & then fell into a fit again: which fits continuing, she was ordered to be had out, & the next to be brought in, viz: [Bridget Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html)

Some time afterwards she was called in again, but immediately taken with fits, for a while. 

Have you signed the Devils book? 

No.

Have you not toucht it?  
No.

Then she fell into fits againe, & was sent forth for air.

After a considerable space of time she was brought in again, but could [not] give account of things, by reason of fits, & so sent forth. 

[Mary Warren](/tag/warren_mary.html) called in, afterwards in private, before Magistrates & Ministers.

She said, I shall not speak a word: but I will, #(speak) I will speak satan -- she saith she will kill me. Oh! `she saith, she owes me a spite, & will claw me off -- 

Avoid Satan, for the name of God avoid. And then fell into fits again: & cryed will ye; I will prevent ye in the Name of God,  
Tell us, how far have you yeilded? 

A fit interrupts her again. 

What did they say you should do, & you should be well? 

Then her lips were bit so that she could not speak. so she was sent away 

Note  That not one of the sufferers was afflicted during her examination after once she began to confess, tho they were tormented before.

She Testifys that Her master [Proctor](/tag/proctor_john.html) was always very averse to the putting up Bills for publick prayer. Qu: Did you not know it was the Devils book when you Signed? A: No, But I thought it was no good book. Q: after you had a Mark in the Book what did you think then? A: Then I thought it was the Devil's book. Q. How did you come to know your Master, and Mistris were Witches? A. The Sabbath Even after I had put up my note for thanks in publick, my Mistris appeared to mee, and puld mee out of the Bed, and told mee that Shee was a witch and had put her hand to the Book, she told me this in her Bodily person, and that This Examinant might have known she was a Witch, if she had but minded what Books she read in.  
Q. what did she say to you before you tormented the Children?  A. The night after she told mee she was a Witch, she in person told mee this Examinant, that my self and her son John would quickly be brought out for witches. This Examinant saith that [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) in apparition told her, the night before that the Magistrates were goeing up to the farms to bring down more witches to torment her. Moreover being in a dreadful fit  in the prison she Charged it on Giles Cory, who was then in Close prison, affirming that he came into the Room where she was, and afflicting her, Charged her not to Come into the Other Room while he was Examining. But being sent for and he Commanded to look upon her, He no sooner turned his face to her but shee fel into a dreadful fit again. and upon her Recovery Charged him to his face with being the procurer of it. Moreover the said [Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) in prison formerly threatned her that he would fitt her for itt, because he told her she had Caused her Master to ask more for a peice of Meadow than he was willing to give she Likewise in her fitt in the Other Room before she had seen [Giles Cory](/tag/corey_giles.html) in person, Charging him with afflicting off her, described him in all his garments, both of hat Coat and Colour of them with a Cord about his wast, and a white Cap on his head, and in Chains, as several then in Company Can affirm.
