# (The [Rev. John Hale](/tag/hale_john.html) et al. v. [Sarah Bishop](/tag/bishop_sarah.html) )

[May 20, 1692 ]

[John Hale](/tag/hale_john.html) of Beverly aged about 56 yeares [torn] & saith that  about 5 or 6 years ago e Christian the wife of [John Trask](/tag/trask_john.html) (living in  Salem bounds bordering on the abovesaid Beverly) beeing in full  comunion in o'r Church came to me to [de] sier that [Goodwife Bish- op](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) her Neighb'r wife of [Edw: Bishop Jun'r](/tag/bishop_edward_jr.html) might not be permitted  to receive the Lords Supper in our church till she had given her the  said Trask satisfaction for some offences that were against her.viz be-  cause the said [Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) did entertaine people in her house at unseason-  able houres in the night to keep drinking and playing at shovel-board  whereby discord did arise in other families & young people were in  danger to bee corrupted & that the s'd [Trask](/tag/trask_sarah.html) knew these things  & had once gon into the house & fynding some at shovel-board had  taken the peices thay played with & thrown them into the fyre  & had reprooved the said [Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) for promoting such disorders, But re-  ceived no satisfaction from her about it.

I gave s'd [Christian Trask](/tag/trask_sarah.html) direction how to proceed farther in  this matter if it were clearly prooved And indeed by the information  I have had otherwise I doe fear that if a stop had not been putt to  those disorders s'd [Edw. Bishop's](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) house would have been a house of  great prophainness & iniquity.

But as to [Christian Trask](/tag/trask_sarah.html) the next news I heard of her was that  she was distracted & asking her [husband Trask](/tag/trask_john.html) when she was so taken  [he told] mee shee was taken distracted that night after shee [came  from] my house when shee complained against [Goody Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) .

She continueing some time Distracted wee sought the Lord by  fasting & prayer & the Lord was pleased to restore the s'd [[Trask]](/tag/trask_sarah.html)  to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in [her] distraction  (& took it then to bee only distraction, yet fearing sometimes  somw't worse) but since I have seen the fitts of those bewitched at  Salem Village I call to mind some of hers to be much like some of  theirs.

The said [Trask](/tag/trask_sarah.html) when recovered as I understood it did manifest  strong suspicion that shee had been bewitched by the s'd [Bishop's](/tag/bishop_edward_jr.html)  wife & showed so much aversness from having any conversation that  I was then troubled at it hopeing better of s'd [Goody Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) at that  time for wee have since [torn] At length s'd [Christian Trask](/tag/trask_sarah.html) [was]  agen in a distracted fit on a Sabboth day in the forenoon at the pub-  l[i]ck meeting to o'r public desturbance & so continued sometimes  better sometimes worse unto her death, manifesting that shee under  temptation to kill her selfe or somebody else.

I enquired of [Marg'rt Ring](/tag/ring_margaret.html) who kept at or nigh the house, what  shee had observed of s'd [Trask](/tag/trask_sarah.html) before this last distraction shee told  [mee.] [Goody Trask](/tag/trask_sarah.html) was much given to reading & search the pro-  phecys of scrip[ture].

The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house  she[e] came home & said shee had been w'th [Goody Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) & that  they two were now friend or to that effect.

I was oft praying w'th & councelling of [Goody Trask](/tag/trask_sarah.html) before her  death and not many days before her end being there shee seemed  more rationall & earnestly desired [Edw: Bishop](/tag/bishop_edward_jr.html) might be sent for  that shee might make friends with him, I asked her if shee had  wronged [Edw. Bishop](/tag/bishop_edward_jr.html) shee said not that shee knew of unless it were  in taking his shovel-board pieces when people were at play w'th them  & throwing them into the fyre & if she did evill in it she was very  sorry for it & desiered he would be friends with her or forgive her.  this was the very day before she dyed, or a few days before.

Her distraction (or bewitching) continued about a month and in  those intervalls wherein shee was better shee earnestly desired prayers  & the Sabboth befere she dyed I received a note for prayers on her  behalf w'ch her husband said was written by her selfe & I judge was  her owne hand writing beeing well acquainted with her hand.

As to the wounds she dyed of I observed 3 deadly ones; apeice  of her wind pipe cutt out. & another wound above that threww the   windpipe & Gullet & the veine they call jugular. So that I then judge  & still doe apprehend it impossible for her w'th so short a pair of  cissars to mangle her selfe so without some extraordinary work of  the devill or witchcraft
