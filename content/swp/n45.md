# (Examination of [Mary Esty](/tag/esty_mary.html) )

[April 22, 1692]

The Examination of [Mary Eastie](/tag/esty_mary.html) .
At a Court held at Salem village 22. Apr. 1692 

By the Wop. [=worshipful] [John Hathorne](/tag/hathorn_john.html) & [Jonathan Corwin.](/tag/corwin_jonathan.html)
At the bringing in of the the accused severall fell into fits. 
Doth this woman hurt you? 
Many mouths were stopt, & several other fits seized them 
[Abig: Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) said it was [Goody Eastie](/tag/esty_mary.html) , & she had hurt her, the  like said [Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) , & [Ann Putman](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) , [John indian](/tag/indian_john.html) said her saw her with [Goody Hobbs](/tag/hobbs_abigail.html) .
What do you say, are you guilty? 
I can say before Christ Jesus, I am free. 
You see these accuse you. 
There is a God -- 
Hath she brought the book to you? 
Their mouths were stopt. 
What have you done to these children? 
I know nothing. 
How can you say you know nothing, when you see these tormented, & accuse you that you know nothing?
Would you have me accuse my self? 
Yes if you be guilty. 
How far have you complyed w'th Satan whereby he takes this  advantage ag't you?
Sir, I never complyed but prayed against him all my dayes, I  have no complyance with Satan, in this. What would you have  me do?
Confess if you be guilty. 
I will say it, if it was my last time, I am clear of this sin. 
Of what sin? 
Of witchcraft. 
Are you certain this is the woman? 
Never a one could speak for fits. 
By and by [Ann Putman](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) said that was the woman, it was like her,  & she told me her name;
It is marvailous to me that #[she] you should sometimes think  they are bewitcht, & sometimes not, when severall confess that they  have been guilty of bewitching them.
Well Sir would you have me confess that that I never knew? 
Her hands were clincht together, & then the hands of [Mercy Lewis](/tag/lewis_mercy.html) was clincht
Look now you hands are open, her hands are open. 
Is this the woman? 
They made signes but could not speak, but [Ann Putman](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) afterwards [Betty Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html) cryed out Oh. [Goody Easty](/tag/esty_mary.html) , [Goody Easty](/tag/esty_mary.html) you  are the woman, you are the woman
Put up her head, for while her head is bowed the necks of these  are broken.
What do you say to this? 
Why God will know. 
Nay God knows now. 
I know he dos. 
What did you think of the actions of others before your sisters  came out, did you think it was Witchcraft?
I cannot tell. 
Why do you not think it is Witchcraft? 
It is an evil spirit, but wither it be witchcraft I do not know,  Severall said she brought them the Book & then they fell into fits.

Salem Village March 24'th. 1691/2

The humble Request of [Mary Esty](/tag/esty_mary.html) and

Humbly sheweth, that whereas we two Sisters [Mary Esty](/tag/esty_mary.html)  & [Sarah Cloys](/tag/cloyce_sarah.html) stand now before the Honoured court charged with the  suspition of Witchcraft, our humble request is first that seing we are  neither able to plead our owne cause, nor is councell alowed to those in our condicion; that you who are our Judges, would please to be  of councell to us, to direct us wherein we may stand in neede.  Secondly that whereas we are not conscious to ourselves of any  guilt in the least degree of that crime, wherof we are now accused  (in the presence of the Living God we speake it, before whose awfull Tribunall we know we shall ere Long appeare) nor of any other  scandalouse evill, or miscaryage inconsistant with Christianity, Those  who have had the Longest and best knowledge of us, being persons of good report, may be suffered to Testifie upon oath what they know concerning each of us, viz [Mr. Capen](/tag/capen_joseph.html) the pastour and those of  the Towne & Church of Topsfield, who are ready to say somthing  which we hope may be looked upon, as very considerable in this  matter; with the seven children of one of us, viz [Mary Esty](/tag/esty_mary.html) , and it may be produced of Like nature in reference to the wife of [Peter Cloys](/tag/cloyce_peter.html) , her sister. Thirdly that the Testimony of witches, or such as are afflicted, as is supposed, by witches may not be improved to condemn us, without other Legal evidence concurring, we hope the Honoured Court & Jury will be soe tender of the lives of such,  as we are who have for many years Lived under the unblemished reputation of Christianity, as not to condemne them without a fayre and equall hearing of what may be sayd for us, as well as  against us. And your poore supplyants shall be bound always to pray &c.
