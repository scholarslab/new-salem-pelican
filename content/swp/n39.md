# (Fragment of an Examination of [Deliverance Dane](/tag/dane_deliverence.html))

[++ June 29, 1692] [Deliverance Deane](/tag/dane_deliverence.html) being asked why she and the rest brought in Mr. Deane as afflicting persons, she answered, it was Satan's subtilty, for he told her he would put a sham upon all these things, and make people believe that he did afflict. She said Mrs. Osgood and she gave their consent the devil should bring Mr. Deane's shape to afflict. Being asked again if [Mrs. Osgood](/tag/osgood_mary.html) and she acted this business, she said yes.
