# (Petition of Eleven Ministers from Essex County) 
To his Excellency the Governor, Council and Representatives of the Province of the Massachusets Bay, in Generall Court Assembled June 1703 
The Address of severall Ministers of the County of Essex. 

Whereas in the year 1692 some of our neighbours of a good conversation, were apprehended and imprisoned upon suspition of Witchcraft, upon the complaint of some young persons under Diabolicall molestations; and upon their Tryall at the Court at Salem were condemned; great weight being layd upon the evidence of the Afflicted persons, their Accusers Sentence of Death was Executed on severall of them, others were Reprieved. But since it is apparent and hath been Acknowledged, that there were Errors and mistakes in the aforesaid Tryalls; and notwithstanding the care and conscientious endeavour of the Honorable Judges to do the thing that is right: yet there is great reason to fear that Innocent persons then suffered, and that God may have a controversy with the Land upon that account. 

We would therefore humbly propose to the consideration of this Honored Court, whether something may not, and ought not, to be publickly done to clear the good name and reputation of some who have suffered as aforesaid, against whom there was not as is supposed sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of such a crime and for whom there are good grounds of charity. Some of the condemned persons aforesaid, and others in behalf of their Relations who have suffered, have lately Petitioned this Honoured Court upon this Account. We pray that their case may be duely considered.

We whose names are under-written, inhabitants of Andover; whenas that horrible and tremendous judgment beginning at Salem village in the year 1692, by some called witchcraft, first breaking forth at [Mr. Parris's](/tag/parris_samuel.html) house, several young persons, being seemingly afflicted, did accuse several persons for afflicting them, and many there believing it so to be, we being informed that, if a person was sick, the afflicted person could tell what or who was the cause of that sickness: [Joseph Ballard](/tag/ballard_joseph.html) , of Andover, his wife being sick at the same time, he, either from himself or by the advice of others, fetched two of the persons, called the afflicted persons, from Salem village to Andover, which was the beginning of that dreadful calamity that befel us in Andover, believing the said accusations to be true, sent for the said persons to come together to the meeting house in Andover, the afflicted persons being there. After [Mr. Barnard](/tag/barnard_thomas.html) had been at prayer, we were blindfolded, and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their fits and falling into their fits at our coming into their presence, as they said; and some led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they were well, and that we were guilty of afflicting them: Whereupon, we were all seized, as prisoners, by a warrant from the Justice of the peace and forthwith carried to Salem. And, by reason of that sudden surprizal, we knowing ourselves altogether innocent of the crime, we were all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated and affrighted even out of our reason. and our nearest and dearest relations, seeing us in that dreadful condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehended there was no other way to save our lives, as the case was then circumstanced, but by our confessing ourselves to be such and such persons as the afflicted represented us to be, they, out of tenderness and pity, persuaded us to confess what we did confess. And indeed that confession, that it is said we made, was no other than what was suggested to us by some gentlemen, they telling us that we were witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, which made us think that it was so; and our understandings, our reason, our faculties, almost gone, we were not capable of judging of our condition; as also the hard measures they used with us rendered us incapable of making our defence, but said any thing and every thing which they desired, and most of what we said, was but, in effect, a consenting to what they said. Some time after, when we were better composed, they  telling us what we had confessed, we did profess that we were innocent and ignorant of such things; and we hearing that [Samuel Wardwell](/tag/wardwell_samuel.html) had renounced his confession, and quickly after condemned and executed, some of us were told we were going after Wardwell.
