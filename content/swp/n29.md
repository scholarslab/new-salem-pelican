# ( Examination of Elizabeth Cary, as Published by Robert Calef ) 

[++ May 23, 1692]

I having heard some days, that my Wife was accused of Witch-  craft, being much disturbed at it, by advice, we went to Salem-  Village, to see if the afflicted did know her; we arrived there, 24 May, it happened to be a day appointed for Examination; accord-  ingly soon after our arrival, [Mr. Hathorn](/tag/hathorn_john.html) and [Mr. Curwin](/tag/corwin_jonathan.html) , etc., went  to the Meeting-house, which was the place appointed for that Work,  the Minister began with Prayer, and having taken care to get a  convenient place, I observed, that the afflicted were two Girls of  about Ten Years old, and about two or three other, of about eighteen, one of the Girls talked most, and could discern more than the  rest. The Prisoners were called in one by one, and as they came in  were cried out of, etc. The Prisoner was placed about 7 or 8 foot  from the Justices, and the Accusers between the Justices and them;  the Prisoner was ordered to stand right before the Justices, with an Officer appointed to hold each hand, least they should therewith  afflict them, and the Prisoners Eyes must be constantly on the Justices; for if they look'd on the afflicted, they would either fall into their Fits, or cry out of being hurt by them; after Examination of  the Prisoners, who it was afflicted these Girls, etc., they were put upon saying the Lords Prayer, as a tryal of their guilt; after the  afflicted seem'd to be out of their Fits, they would look steadfastly on some one person, and frequently not speak; and then the Justices  said they were struck dumb, and after a little time would speak again;  then the Justices said to the Accusers, “which of you will go and  touch the Prisoner at the Bar?” then the most couragious would ad-  venture, but before they had made three steps would ordinarily fall  down as in a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be taken up  and carried to the Prisoner, that she might touch them; and as soon  as they were touched by the accused, the Justices would say, they are  well, before I could discern any alteration; by which I observed that  the Justices understood the manner of it. Thus far I was only as  a Spectator, my Wife also was there part of the time, but no notice  taken of her by the afflicted, except once or twice they came to her  and asked her name.

But I having an opportunity to Discourse [Mr. Hale](/tag/hale_john.html) (with whom  I had formerly acquaintance) I took his advice, what I had best to do, and desired of him that I might have an opportunity to speak  with her that accused my Wife; which he promised should be, I  acquainting him that I reposed my trust in him.

Accordingly he came to me after the Examination was over,  and told me I had now an opportunity to speak with the said Accuser,  viz . [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html) , a Girl of 11 or 12 Years old; but that we could  not be in private at [Mr. Parris's](/tag/parris_samuel.html) House, as he had promised me; we  went therefore into the Alehouse, where an Indian Man attended us, who it seems was one of the afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder, he shewed several Scars, that seemed as if they had been long there,  and shewed them as done by Witchcraft, and acquainted us that his  Wife, who also was a Slave, was imprison'd for Witchcraft. And now  instead of one Accuser, they all came in, who began to tumble down  like Swine, and then three Women were called in to attend them.  We in the Room were all at a stand, to see who they would cry  out of; but in a short time they cried out, [Cary](/tag/cary_elizabeth.html) ; and immediately after a Warrant was sent from the Justices to bring my Wife before  them, who were sitting in a Chamber near by, waiting for this.

Being brought before the Justices, her chief accusers were two Girls; my Wife declared to the Justices, that she never had any knowledge of them before that day; she was forced to stand with her  Arms stretched out. I did request that I might hold one of her  hands, but it was denied me; then she desired me to wipe the Tears  from her Eyes, and the Sweat from her Face, which I did; then she  desired she might lean her self on me, saying, she should faint.

Justice Hathorn replied, she had strength enough to torment  those persons, and she should have strength enough to stand. I  speaking something against their cruel proceedings, they commanded  me to be silent, or else I should be turned out of the Room. The  Indian before mentioned, was also brought in, to be one of her  Accusers: being come in, he now (when before the Justices) fell  down and tumbled about like a Hog, but said nothing. The Justices  asked the Girls, who afflicted the Indian? they answered she ( meaning my Wife) and now lay upon him; the Justices ordered her to touch  him, in order to his cure, but her head must be turned another way, least instead of curing, she should make him worse, by her looking on him, her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian took  hold on her hand, and pulled her down on the Floor, in a barbarous  manner; then his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and  the cure was quickly wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their  Inhumane dealings, uttered a hasty Speech (That God would take vengeance on them, and desired that God would deliver us out of the hands of unmerciful men.) Then her Mittimus was writ. I did with  difficulty and charge obtain the liberty of a Room, but no Beds in it;  if there had, could have taken but little rest that Night. She was  committed to Boston Prison; but I obtained a Habeas Corpus to  remove her to Cambridge Prison, which is in our County of Middlesex. Having been there one Night, next Morning the Jaylor put  Irons on herlegs (having received such a command) the weight of them was about eight pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions, soon brought her into Convulsion Fits, so that I thought she would  have died that Night. I sent to intreat that the Irons might be taken  off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would have saved her Life,  so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at Salem coming on, I went thither, to see how things were there managed;  and finding that the Spectre-Evidence was there received, together with Idle, if not malicious Stories, against Peoples Lives, I did easily  perceive which way the rest would go; for the same Evidence that  served for one, would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her with her  danger; and that if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she  would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal  in our own County, I with several others Petitioning the Judge for  it, and were put in hopes of it; but I soon saw so much, that I understood thereby it was not intended, which put me upon consulting  the means of her escape; which thro the goodness of God was effected, and she got to Road Island, but soon found her self not safe  when there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she  went to New York, along with some others that had escaped their cruel hands; where we found his Excellency [Benjamin Fletcher](/tag/fletcher_benjamin.html) ,  Esq; Governour, who was very courteous to us. After this some of  my Goods were seized in a Friends hands, with whom I had left them,  and my self imprisoned by the Sheriff, and kept in Custody half a day, and then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Prisoners,  and their Inhumanity shewn to them, at the time of their Execution,  no sober Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; which is the more, considering what a People for Religion, I mean  the profession of it, we have been; those that suffered being many of  them Church-Members, and most of them unspotted in their Con-  versation, till their Adversary the Devil took up this Method for accusing them.  
                                                                        Per [Nathaniel Cary.](/tag/cary_nathaniel.html)
