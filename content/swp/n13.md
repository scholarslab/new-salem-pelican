# (Examination of [Bridget Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html), as Recorded by [Samuel Parris](/tag/parris_samuel.html))

[April 19, 1692]

The Examination of [Bridget Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) at Salem village  19. Apr. 1692  ["2" written over "3"]  By [John Hauthorn](/tag/hathorn_john.html) & [Jonath: Corwin](/tag/corwil_jonathan.html) Esq'rs

As soon as she came near all fell into fits  [Bridget Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html), You are now brought before Authority to give acc'o  of what witchcrafts you are conversant in

I take all this people (turning her head & eyes about) to witness  that I am clear.

Hath this woman hurt you speaking to the afflicted. 

#[A( )b Hubb( )d][Eliz: Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html), [Ann Putman](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html), [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html), & [Mercy Lewes](/tag/lewis_mercy.html)  affirmed she had hurt them.

You are here accused by 4. or .5. for hurting them, what do you  say to it?

I never saw these persons before; nor I never was in this place  before.

[Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) sais that her brother [Jonathan](/tag/walcott_john.html) stroke her appearance  & she saw that #[ha] he had tore her coat in striking, & she heard it tare.

Upon #[sea] some search in the Court, a rent that seems to answere  what was alledged was found.

They say you bewitcht your first husband to death.

If it please your worship I know nothing of it. 

She shake her head & the afflicted were tortured. 

The like again upon the motion of her head. 

[Sam: Braybrook](/tag/braybrook_samuel.html) affirmed that she told him to day that she had  been accounted a Witch these .10. years, but she was no Witch, the  Devil cannot hurt her.

I am no Witch. 

Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how far you  have gone? Have you not to do with familiar Spirits?

I have no familiarity with the Devil. 

How is it then, that your appearance doth hurt these? 

I am innocent. 

Why you seem to act Witchcraft before us, by the motion of your  body, which #[has in] seems to have influence fluence upon the afflicted.

I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a Witch. I know not what  a Witch is.

How do you know then that you are not a witch? #[and yet know not what a Witch is?] 

I do not #[understand] know what you say. 

How can you know, you are no Witch, & yet not know what a  Witch is:

I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it. 

You may threaten, but you can do no more than you are per-  mitted.

I am innocent of a Witch. 

What do you say of those murders you are charged with? 

I hope, I am not guilty of Murder. 

Then she turned up her eyes, & #[they] the eyes of the afflicted were  turned up

It may be you do not know, that any have confessed to day, who  have been examined before you, that they are Witches.

No, I know nothing of it. 

[John Hutchinson](/tag/hutchinson_john.html) & [John Hewes](/tag/hewes_john.html) in open Court affirmed that they  had told her

Why look you, you are taken now in a flat lye. 

I did not hear them. 

Note  Sam: Gold saith that after this examination he ask't s'd  [Bridget Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) if she were not troubled to see the afflicted persons  so tormented, said [Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) answered no, she was not troubled for  them: Then he ask't her whither she thought they were bewitcht,  she said she could not tell what to think about them. [Will Good](/tag/good_william.html),  & [John Buxton jun'r](/tag/buxton_john.html) was by, & he supposeth they heard her also.

Salem Village Aprill the .19'th 1692 [m'r Sam'l Parris](/tag/parris_samuel.html) being  desired to take into Wrighting the Examination of [Bridget Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html),  hath delivered it as aforesaid And upon hearing the same, and   seeing what wee did then see, togather wit[] the Charge of the afflic-  ted persons th[] present; Wee Committed s'd [Bridg[] Olliver](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) --

The examination of [Bridget Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) before the Worshipfull  [John Harthon](/tag/hathorn_john.html) and [Jonathan Curren](/tag/corwil_jonathan.html) esq'rs

The afflicted persons charge her, with having hurt them  many wayes and by tempting them to sine to the devils Booke at which  charge shee seemed to be very angrie and shaking her head at them   saying it was false they are all greatly tormented (as I conceive) by  the shaking of her head

[good Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) what contract have you made with the  devill

I have made no contract with the devill I never saw him in  my life. [An Putnam](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html) sayeth that shee calls the devill her God

(Mr H) who is it that doth it if you doe not they say it is your  likenes that comes and torments them and tempts them to write in  the booke what Booke is that you tempt them with.

(Bish)I know nothing of it I am innocent.

I am innocent I know nothing of it I am no witch I know  not what a witch is.
