# (Examination of [Bridget Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html), as Recorded by [Samuel Parris](/tag/parris_samuel.html))

[April 19, 1692]

   The Examination of [Bridget  
   Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) at Salem village  
   19. Apr. 1692  ["2" written over "3"]  
   By [John Hauthorn](/tag/hathorn_john.html) & [Jonath: Corwin](/tag/corwin_jonathan.html) Esq'rs

As soon as she came near all fell into fits

[Bridget Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html), You are now brought before Authority to give acc'o  of what witchcrafts you are conversant in

I take all this people (turning her head & eyes about) to witness that I am clear.

Hath this woman hurt you speaking to the afflicted. 

[Eliz: Hubbard](/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html), [Ann Putman](/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html), [Abigail Williams](/tag/williams_abigail.html), & [Mercy Lewes](/tag/lewis_mercy.html) affirmed she had hurt them.

You are here accused by 4. or .5. for hurting them, what do you  say to it?

I never saw these persons before; nor I never was in this place  before.

[Mary Walcot](/tag/walcott_mary.html) sais that her brother [Jonathan](/tag/walcott_john.html) stroke her appearance  & she saw that #[ha] he had tore her coat in striking, & she heard it tare.

Upon #[sea] some search in the Court, a rent that seems to answere what was alledged was found.

They say you bewitcht your first husband to death.

If it please your worship I know nothing of it. 

She shake her head & the afflicted were tortured. 

The like again upon the motion of her head. 

[Sam: Braybrook](/tag/braybrook_samuel.html) affirmed that she told him to day that she had been accounted a Witch these .10. years, but she was no Witch, the  Devil cannot hurt her.

I am no Witch. 

Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how far you  have gone? Have you not to do with familiar Spirits?

I have no familiarity with the Devil. 

How is it then, that your appearance doth hurt these? 

I am innocent. 

Why you seem to act Witchcraft before us, by the motion of your body, which #[hasin] seems to have influence fluence upon the afflicted.

I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a Witch. I know not what  a Witch is.

How do you know then that you are not a witch? #[and yet know not what a Witch is?] 

I do not #[understand] know what you say. 

How can you know, you are no Witch, & yet not know what a Witch is:

I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it. 

You may threaten, but you can do no more than you are permitted.

I am innocent of a Witch. 

What do you say of those murders you are charged with? 

I hope, I am not guilty of Murder. 

Then she turned up her eyes, & #[they] the eyes of the afflicted were turned up

It may be you do not know, that any have confessed to day, who  have been examined before you, that they are Witches.

No, I know nothing of it. 

[John Hutchinson](/tag/hutchinson_john.html) & [John Hewes](/tag/hewes_john.html) in open Court affirmed that they  had told her

Why look you, you are taken now in a flat lye. 

I did not hear them. 

Note  Sam: Gold saith that after this examination he  
ask't s'd  [Bridget Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) if she were not troubled to see  
the afflicted persons so tormented, said [Byshop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) answered  
no, she was not troubled for them: Then he ask't her  
whither she thought they were bewitcht, she said she could  
not tell what to think about them. [Will Good](/tag/good_william.html),  & [John  
Buxton jun'r](/tag/buxton_john.html) was by, & he supposeth they hear(d) her also.

Salem Village Aprill the .19'th 1692  
[m'r Sam'l Parris](/tag/parris_samuel.html) being desired to take into  
Wrighting the Examination of [Bridget Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html),  
hath delivered it as aforesaid  
And upon hearing the same, and seeing

The examination of [Bridget Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) before the Worshipfull [John Harthon](/tag/hathorn_john.html) and [Jonathan Curren](/tag/corwin_jonathan.html) esq'rs

[Bridget Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) being now comeing in to be examined relating to her accusation of suspicon of sundry acts of witchcrafts the afflicted persons are now dreadfully afflicted by her as they doe say (Mr Harthorn [John Harthon](/tag/hathorn_john.html) )

The afflicted persons charge her, with having hurt them  many wayes and by tempting them to sine to the devils Booke at which  charge shee seemed to be very angrie and shaking her head at them   saying it was false they are all greatly tormented (as I conceive) by  the shaking of her head

(mr Har) [good Bishop](/tag/bishop_bridget.html) what contract have you made with the devill
