<h3>Bridget Bishop</h3>
<p> Bridget Bishop was the first person to be executed during the 
  Salem witchcraft trials. In Salem folklore, she is portrayed as a feisty, fun-loving, 
  lusty, innkeeper who can't seem to keep herself out of trouble. Recently, historians 
  have painted a somewhat different picture, owing to the confusion with Sarah 
  Bishop who also appears in the court records of the witch trials. Indisputably, 
  the Bridget Bishop who was tried and hanged possessed a quick wit and independent 
  spirit that could not be crushed by the court of Oyer and Terminer. </p>

<h3>
			Bridget Bishop
		</h3>
<p>Written By Sarah-Nell Walsh</p>
<p>Actress Rebekah Clinard as Bridget Bishop in History Alive production of 'Cry Innocent,'
			by Mark Stevick, Salem, Summer, 1999.</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Bridget Bishop has developed into a colorful character in the legendary history of Salem
			Village. As the first woman tried and executed as a witch during the Salem witchcraft
			trials, she has attracted a lot of imaginative speculation about her character and
			behavior.</p>
<p>The Bridget Bishop that is most commonly portrayed is one who kept a house of refreshment
			for travelers, and a shuffle board for the entertainment of her guests. She generally
			seemed to have exhibited certain behaviors and appearances that exposed her to some
			scandal. She wore a showy costume for the austere Puritan times -- a red bodice. Her
			freedom from the severity of Puritan manners and disregard of conventional decorum in
			her conversation and conduct brought her into disrepute, so the tongue of gossip was
			generally loosened against her. She is portrayed as a folk heroine in Salem's story. A
			spirited, feisty, buxom, and lusty woman who flaunted Puritan morals with a happy public
			house where drinking and gambling occurred. Many say that it was her flashy taste in
			dress, her smooth and flattering manner with men, and the questionable gaieties that had
			gone on in her two taverns, which led to people gossiping about her as a witch as far
			back as King Philips War.</p>
<p>This, however, is not the same Bridget Bishop of history. Research done by historian
			David Green indicates that scholars and writers have confused Bridget Bishop of Salem
			with Sarah Bishop, a tavern keeper in Salem Village. Bridget Bishop lived on a small
			piece of property in Salem Town and was between fifty-five and sixty-five in 1692, when
			she was accused of witchcraft. The account below follows the more historically accurate
			description of Bridget Bishop's life, taken from Bernard Rosenthal's book Salem
			Story.</p>
<p>In 1666, the widow Bridget Wasselbe married Thomas Oliver and had a daughter named
			Christian. This marriage was less than idyllic. In 1678, Bridget was accused of calling
			her husband names on the Sabbath, and both she and her husband were sentenced to stand
			gagged in the market place for their offenses. In January 1679, Bridget and Thomas were
			both sentenced to be whipped for fighting. It was not unusual for Bridget's face to be
			battered during her marriage to Thomas Oliver. In 1680, she was accused of witchcraft.
			This accusation could have been facilitated by Thomas' claim that "she was a bad wife .
			. .the devil had come bodily to her . . . and she sat up all night with the devil."
			(Charles Upham, Salem Witchcraft). This accusation occurred after her husband died
			without leaving a will, and seems to be the classic case of a vulnerable, propertied
			woman being accused of witchcraft. She posted bond, and there is no record of any
			punishment. In 1687, she was charged with stealing brass objects. Her record then
			remains clean until she is brought up on witchcraft charges again in April 1692.</p>
<p>On April 19, 1692 at her examination, Bridget Bishop began her testimony with courtesy
			and deference. This deferential attitude soon gave way to anger as she realized that
			denying her involvement was not an effective strategy. The afflicted girls were in the
			courtroom swooning in response to the imagined spectral advances of Bridget Bishop.
			Magistrate John Hawthorne unleashed his loaded questions, asking, "How is it that your
			specter hurts those in this room?" Bridget replied, "I am innocent to a witch. I know
			not what a witch is." Hawthorne turned this answer to his advantage by asking, "How can
			you know, you are no witch, and yet not know what a witch is." She replied, "I am clear:
			if I were any such person you should know it." Although it is not clear what Bridget
			meant by this comment, Hawthorne clearly took it as a veiled threat and replied, "You
			may threaten, but you may do no more than you are permitted" (Salem Witchcraft papers).
			No one can know for certain if this bold interchange earned Bridget Bishop the
			distinction of being the first hanged on the gallows.</p>
<p>On May 27, Phips established a special court of Oyer and Terminer to try those accused of
			witchcraft. On June 2, Bridget Bishop was the first person tried in the new court,
			perhaps because her previous witchcraft accusation made her a likely candidate. In her
			trial, spectral evidence was given an unprecedented status. She was charged with
			"tortur[ing], afflict[ing], pin[ing], consum[ing], wast[ing]: &amp; torment[ing] her
			victims," Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam Jr., Mercy Lewis, Mary Walcott, and Elizabeth
			Hubbard. Bridget vehemently denied the charges at her trial, believing that to be the
			only way to avoid execution. She did not realize that her only hope lay in confessing to
			witchcraft. When Cotton Mather wrote of the evidence against her in his book Wonders of
			the Invisible World, he included preposterous stories that could best be called gossip.
			One such story recounts that Bishop cast a glance upon Salem meeting house, while
			walking under guard. This "look" caused a board, which had been fastened with nails, to
			be removed to another portion of the house. Her case served as a model for future cases
			to come, following a very predictable pattern. The "afflicted" persons made their
			accusations, which were denied by the accused; members of the community told of past
			acts of witchcraft by the accused; and one or more confessors validated the claim of the
			accusers. The court used spectral evidence as the primary legal basis to convict Bridget
			Bishop. Hanged on June 10, her death warrant emphasizes only the harm done to her
			accusers, primarily on the day of her examination, as the legal justification for the
			execution.</p>
<p>"On June 10, 1692, High Sheriff George Corwin took [Bridget Bishop] to the top of Gallows
			Hill and hanged her alone from the branches of a great oak tree. Now the honest men of
			Salem could sleep in peace, sure that the Shape of Bridget would trouble them no more"
			(Upham). Bridget Bishop was the first person to be hanged as a result of the infamous
			Salem witchcraft trials. </p>

<h3>Bridget Bishop</h3>
<p>Written By Sarah Nell Walsh</p>
<p>Bridget Bishop was a self-assertive woman who had been accused of witchcraft 
prior to 1692. Previous experience had taught her to deny allegations 
of witchcraft at all costs. Unfortunately, in 1692 the situation was 
different and her only salvation lay in false confession, which she 
refused to do. Bridget Bishop was married to Edward Bishop when she 
was accused of witchcraft in Salem. She was widowed twice before marrying 
Edward. Her second husband Thomas Oliver accused her of witchcraft, 
claiming that "she was a bad wife. . . the devil had come bodily to 
her . . . and she sat up all night with the devil." This previous accusation 
of witchcraft in 1680 was remembered and probably explains her arrest 
and sentencing in 1692.</p>
<p>John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin presided over Bridget's examination 
on April 19, 1692. Many of her accusers were present at the examination, 
including Elizabeth Hubbard, Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams, Mercy Lewis, 
and Mary Walcott. A summary of the courtroom examination follows. </p>
<p>As soon as Bridget Bishop entered the courtroom, the afflicted girls 
fell into fits. Judge Hathorne asked which witchcrafts she was conversant 
in, to which she replied, "I take all this people (turning her head 
and eyes about) to witness that I am clear." Then Hawthorne asked the 
girls if they had been afflicted by Bishop, to which Elizabeth Hubbard, 
Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams, and Mercy Lewis affirmed that she had. 
The afflicted girls charged her with having hurt them in many ways and 
tempting them to sign the book of the devil. Ann Putnam even went so 
far as to say that Bishop called the devil her God. Bishop continued 
to proclaim her innocence by saying that she "never saw these persons 
before, nor [ever] was in this place before." She claimed to be as "innocent 
as an unborn child." </p>
<p>At that point, Mary Walcott said that her brother Jonathan had torn 
Bishop's coat while fighting off her specter. When they examined Bishop's 
coat, they found the tear in exactly the same location. Judge Hathorne 
continued the attack on Bishop when he accused her of bewitching her 
first husband to death. She shook her head no in response to the question, 
which set the afflicted girls into fits. Sam Braybook affirmed that 
although she told him that she had been accused of witchcraft ten years 
ago, "she was no witch and the devil cannot hurt her."</p>
<p>Bridget Bishop apparently became frustrated with Hathorne's continual 
attack on her character and his disbelief in her innocence. Her deferential 
attitude soon gave way to anger as she slowly realized that denial was 
not an effective strategy. The following interchange between Bishop 
and Hathorne is very memorable and is often quoted. </p>
<p>Bishop staunchly states, "I am no witch." To which Hawthorne replies, 
"Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how far you have 
gone? Have you not to do with familiar spirits?" "I have no familiarity 
with the devil." "How is it then that your appearance doth hurt these?"</p>
<p>"I am innocent."</p>
<p>"Why do you seem to act witchcraft before us, by the motion of your 
body, which seems to have influence upon the afflicted."</p>
<p>"I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a witch. I know not what a witch 
is."</p>
<p>"How do you know then that you are not a witch."</p>
<p>"I do not know what you say."</p>
<p>"How can you know, you are no witch, and yet not know what a witch is."</p>
<p>"I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it."</p>
<p>"You may threaten, but you can do no more than you are permitted"</p>
<p>"I am innocent of a witch."</p>
<p>After this comment, Bridget apparently rolled her eyes towards heaven. 
Immediately, all the girls rolled theirs, and it seemed to the court 
that a devil was on the loose. After this examination, Bishop was asked 
if she was not troubled to see the afflicted girls so tormented. She 
answered no. When asked if she thought they were bewitched, she answered 
that she did not know what to think about them.</p>
<p>Cotton Mather, using the court records, wrote about the trial of Bridget 
Bishop in his book Wonders of the Invisible World. The trial 
was held on June 2, 1692 in the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Even Mather 
admitted that it was hard to prove the witchcraft, even though "it [was] 
evident and notorious to all beholders." During Bishop's examination 
before the magistrates, the afflicted girls behaved as if they were 
tortured. It seemed that by casting her eye upon them, Bishop could 
strike them down into fits. The only thing that would stop these fits 
was the touch of her hand upon the girls. Abigail Hobbs, a woman who 
had already confessed to being a witch, played into this drama by testifying 
that Bishop's specter tormented her because of her confession. She also 
affirmed that Bishop had been present at a meeting of witches, in a 
field at Salem Village, and took part in a diabolical sacrament.</p>
<p>In addition to this evidence, evidence of other previous witchcraft 
was brought to light. Bishop was accused of murdering children, bewitching 
pigs, and coming to various townsmen during the night. In further evidence, 
"poppets" were found in the wall of her cellar. These puppets were made 
of rags and hogs bristles, with headless pins in them. Bishop could 
"give no account unto the court, that was reasonable or tolerable." 
The final piece of damning evidence was when a jury of women found a 
"preternatural teat" upon her body. Within three hours, the teat had 
disappeared, adding to the intrigue.</p>
<p>Her case served as a model for future cases to come, following a very 
predictable pattern. The afflicted girls made accusations, which were 
denied by the accused; one or more confessors validated the claim of 
the accusers; and members of the community told of past acts of witchcraft 
by the accused. The court used spectral evidence as the only legal basis 
to convict Bridget Bishop. Hanged on June 10, her death warrant emphasizes 
only the harm done to her accusers, primarily on the day of her examination, 
as the legal justification for the execution. Bridget Bishop was the 
first person to be hanged as a result of the infamous Salem witchcraft 
trials. </p>

<h3>George Burroughs</h3>
<p>George Burroughs was the only Puritan minister indicted and executed 
  in Salem in 1692. He served as minister of Salem Village from 1680 until he 
  left in 1683. As one of the succession of three ministers who left the Village 
  in the years leading up to the trials, he became involved in the Village's social 
  conflicts. During his stay in Salem he borrowed money from the Putnam family 
  and when he was unable to pay it back, conflict with the Putnams arose. It was 
  at this point that he left. Although he eventually repaid his loan, twelve years 
  later, he was charged, arrested and brought back to Salem from Wells, Maine. 
  Many members of the Salem Village and Andover testified against him and called 
  him the "ring leader" of the witches, a virtual priest of the devil. 
  Cotton Mather also took particular interest in the trial because of Burroughs' 
  unorthodox religious beliefs and practices. He was found guilty and executed 
  on August 19, 1692. His hanging was the only one attended by Cotton Mather, 
  who urged the sympathetic crowd against him. </p>

<h3>
			George Burroughs
		</h3>
<p>Written by Amy Nichols (2001) and Elizabeth Whelan, 2002</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2002</p>
<p>Burroughs has often been portrayed in popular accounts of the trials mainly because some
			of his accusers claimed that he was the "ring leader" of the witches and also because of
			the especially dramatic nature of his execution in the presence of the Rev. Cotton
			Mather. Recent research by Mary Beth Norton has revealed that in order to understand
			George Burroughs' role in the Salem witch trials, it is necessary to see the connection
			between the witchcraft episode in Salem Village and the war that was taking place in
			Maine's northeastern frontier. In her book, In the Devil's Snare, Norton writes,
			"Burroughs, in many ways the key figure in the entire affair, linked Salem Village and
			Falmouth, Essex County and Maine, the Wabanakis and the witches."</p>
<p>George Burroughs was born to a rather well to do family in Suffolk, England in about
			1652. At a young age he left England for Massachusetts Bay Colony and was raised by his
			mother in the town of Roxbury. He later attended Harvard College and graduated in 1670.
			He then moved to Maine and started preaching in Falmouth (now Portland) until Indians
			attacked the town in 1676 forcing him to leave. Eventually, in 1680 he was called to
			Salem Village to be the new minister.</p>
<p>Ann Putnam, Jr., Burroughs' initial accuser, was not personally acquainted with him, but
			she had most likely heard about him from Mercy Lewis, a 17 year-old servant in the
			Putnam family. Lewis was a refugee from the Indian attacks in Maine and knew Burroughs
			as a child. Ann Putnam, like many other accusers, probably turned gossip into a formal
			accusation.</p>
<p> Ann claimed that Burroughs, was the leader of the witches and had sided with the
			Wabanaki Indians and, moreover, that he bewitched Sir Edmond Andros's troops. In the
			eyes of the local gossips, Burroughs' perceived ties to the Indians and Satan were seen
			as one and the same in. Norton explains that he was described as "black," a term that
			suggests a connection both to the "black" Indians and to Satan, known as the "black
			man." Word spread that Burroughs had survived several brutal attacks by the Indians when
			nearly all the other defenders at the fort where he was stationed were murdered, people
			became suspicious -- did Burroughs survive by witchcraft?.</p>
<p>Ann had probably heard through a chain of gossip that Burroughs was jealous that Andros
			employed Deodat Lawson in a position that Burroughs had wanted. Soon after, Lawson's
			daughter and wife died. Ann told the grand jury that she had seen the ghost of Mrs.
			Lawson, who told her that Burroughs had killed her and her daughter because of a
			disagreement between him and her husband. </p>
<p>Another factor working against Burroughs was the fact that his first two wives had died.
			Members of the Putnam family testified that he was cruel to his wives, one of whom was
			related to Judge Hathorne. Ann Putnam claimed that the two wives came to her as visions
			and told her that Burroughs had killed them and that he was indeed working for the
			Devil. Burroughs was also known for his superhuman strength. Men at the trial testified
			that they had seen him "put his fingers into the Bung Barrall and lifted it up, and
			carried it round him and set it downe again." Others claimed that he was able to
			effortlessly lift up a six-foot gun using one hand. His brute strength was more proof of
			his allegiance with the devil.</p>
<p>All this testimony led the court to conclude that Burroughs was indeed a sorcerer and was
			in fact the leader of the witchcraft-related events. On April 30, 1692, Burroughs,
			together with several others, was accused of witchcraft. Thomas Putnam and Jonathan
			Walcott signed the original document of complaint stating the charges. Burroughs was
			charged with "high suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft done or committed by then upon
			the bodies of Mary Walcot Marcy Lewis Abigail Williams Ann Putnam and Eliz. Hubbard and
			Susan Sheldon." On May 4, 1692, he was forcefully taken from his home in Wells, Maine,
			to Salem, and put in jail.</p>
<p>Boyer and Nissenbaum suggest that Burroughs was used as a scapegoat. By attributing to
			him the role of the ringleader, the witchcraft problem was no longer associated with the
			community of Salem Village but was put upon the shoulders of one man, George
			Burroughs.</p>
<p>Bernard Rosenthal has also pointed to Burroughs' reputation for having unconventional
			religious beliefs. In Salem Story, Rosenthal, stresses the significanceof the fact that
			the Rev. Increase Mather and his son Cotton Mather, both prominent ministers in Boston,
			did not agree with Burroughs' religious convictions. Rosenthal concludes that the
			Mathers approval of Burroughs' conviction as a witch may have concealed suspicions that
			he was in fact a Baptist and a witch. </p>
<p>Cotton Mather was at this time known for his cautionary writings on the use of spectral
			evidence in the trials. However, as Rosenthal suggests, in Burroughs' case Mather put
			aside his views on the unreliability of spectral evidence, further suggesting that
			Mather's hatred of Burroughs was based on Burroughs' role as a religious dissident. </p>
<p>For this reason, scholars have traditionally seen Burroughs as the one person executed
			for witchcraft for his religious beliefs. On August 3, 1692, many testified against
			Burroughs. Elizabeth Hubbard, Mercy Lewis, Susannah Sheldon, Mary Walcott and Ann Putnam
			all claimed that he had come to them and tried to force them to sign his book which
			Elizabeth said was written in words "as red as blood." Accused witches such as Abigail
			Hobbs and Mary Warren also charged him with bringing them into the world of Satan. He
			was the "ring leader of them all" holding the meetings in Salem.</p>
<p> Burroughs' trial was the only one attended by Increase Mather. Mather believed that if
			someone could perfectly recite the Lord's Prayer then he or she was not a witch.
			However, as Robert Calef writes in his book More Wonders of the Invisible World, "Mr.
			Burroughs was carried, through the streets of Salem to Execution; when he was upon the
			Ladder, he made a Speech for the clearing of his Innocency, with such Solemn and Serious
			Expressions, as were to the Admiration of all present; his Prayer (which he concluded by
			repeating the Lord's Prayer) was so well worded, and uttered with such composedness, and
			such (at least seeming) fervency of Spirit, as was very affecting, and drew Tears from
			many ( so that is seemed to some that the Spectators would hinder the Execution)".</p>
<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne describes this scene in his powerful story Main Street and refers to
			Burroughs as going to a "martyr's death". Hawthorne depicts Burroughs as an innocent
			victim of the terrible trials. When the crowd calls for the execution to be stopped
			Hawthorne continues "Ah no; for listen to the wise Cotton Mather, who, as he sits there
			on his horse, speaks comfortable to the perplexed multitude, and tells them that all had
			been religiously and justly done, and that Satan's power shall this day receive its
			death-blow in New England". Calef recorded that, "Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon
			a Horse, addressed himself to the People, partly to declare, that he [George Burroughs]
			was no ordained minister, and partly to possess the People of his guilt; saying, That
			the Devil has often been transformed into an Angel of Light." In doing this he reassured
			the crowd of Burroughs' guilt and the execution proceeded.</p>

  as a witch during the Salem outbreak on August 19, 1692. The Salem documents 
  themselves, however, reveal that her crime was not witchcraft but an independence 
  of mind and an unsubmissive character. A daughter of one of the founding families 
  of Andover, Martha married a young Welsh servant, Thomas Carrier, in 1674, by 
  whom she had four children. The Salem accusation against Martha came only two 
  years after the selectmen of Andover blamed a smallpox epidemic on her witchcraft. 
  Although historians have blamed her accusation on causes ranging from a conspiracy 
  against Andover's proprietary families to reaction against threats to patriarchal 
  inheritance, her contentious spirit and the earlier charge of witchcraft seem 
  the most plausible explanation. </p>

<h3>
			Martha Carrier
		</h3>
<p>By Kate Murphy</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Best remembered in popular lore as the 'rampant hag' described by Cotton Mather, modern
			historical studies demonstrate that Martha Carrier was a victim of Salem's outbreak of
			witchcraft accusations. Carrier was accused of being in league with the devil by the
			circle of "afflicted" girls, neighbors and even her own children, and hanged as a witch
			on August 19, 1692. Like many of accused witches, Carrier was a poor, disagreeable
			woman, for whom this was not the first accusation of witchcraft.</p>
<p>Born Martha Allen, daughter of one of the original founders of the Massachusetts town of
			Andover, in 1674 Martha married below her station to a young Welsh servant and father of
			her illegitimate child, Thomas Carrier. Living for a few years in Billerica, the couple
			returned to Andover in the 1680's with very little money and four children. Martha's
			independent spirit and lack of deference seem to have quickly alienated her from the
			rest of the community. The turning point came in 1690 when a smallpox epidemic erupted
			in the town. Although her family, particularly the men, accounted for 7 of the 13 who
			died of smallpox in the town, the community of Andover blamed Martha for the
			tragedy.</p>
<p>Carrier's reputation as a witch found new expression two years later when the outbreak in
			Salem began. As the testimony of the circle of accusing girls reflected, the Salem
			community was well aware of Andover's gossip. Susan Sheldon, Mary Walcot, Elizabeth
			Hubbard and Ann Putnam screamed before the court that they could see the 13 ghosts of
			Andover. Other neighbors accused her of maleficium, testifying that after harsh words
			from her, evil things like sick or dead animals or strange illnesses befell them. During
			her courtroom examination, however, Carrier stood her ground and boldly asserted that
			those who accused her lied. Asked if she could then look upon the girls, seemingly
			possessed, without their writhing in pain, she said she would not, for "they will
			dissemble if I look upon them." Later, she admonished the magistrates, saying "it is a
			shamefull thing that you should mind these folks that are out of their wits."</p>
<p>Accusations of witchcraft extended beyond Martha to the rest of her family. Her sons
			Richard and Andrew, ages 18 and 15 respectively, were tied neck to heels until blood was
			ready to come out of their noses. Under such intense pressure, Martha's own children,
			including seven-year-old Sarah and ten-year-old Thomas, Jr., testified against her and
			confessed themselves to be witches. Young Sarah told the court that she had been a
			"witch Ever Since She was Six years Old that her Moth'r brought a red book to her and
			She touched it." The assistant minister Thomas Barnard who was responsible for these
			confessions, managed to get confessions from all but two of accused witches, including
			Martha, who were also members of his congregation.</p>
<p>One explanation for the targeting of the Carrier family depends upon a conspiracy theory
			that holds that the motive of the Andover accusations was to punish and remove political
			power and social influence from the founding families of Andover. According to the
			originator of this theory, Enders Robinson, (see his book, Salem Witchcraft) a group of
			ten accusers were in league with Andover's assistant minister Rev. Thomas Barnard in
			order to gain control over the town's affairs by discrediting the senior minister, Rev.
			Francis Dane, and the leading families through witchcraft accusations. Robinson points
			to the concentration of Andover accusations within families were either related to Rev.
			Francis Dane or to the powerful founding families. Although the correspondence he finds
			between these groups is interesting, there is no strong evidence supporting such a
			conspiracy.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation, put forward by Carol Karlsen in her book ,I The Devil in the
			Shape of a Woman, blames the disruption to the existing socio-economic order that women
			inheriting a significant amount of money or property would cause. Karlsen argues that a
			sizable group of accused women were not the typical marginalized women, but wealthy and
			prominent members of the community, who shared an unusual place within society as
			primary heirs to money and property. Although Martha might have inherited some property
			after the majority of her male relatives died in the smallpox epidemic of 1690, such an
			inheritance would have been minimal. More likely, Martha's established reputation as a
			witch and as a disagreeable woman made her a target once the momentum of accusations got
			out of control in Salem.</p>

<h3>Giles Corey</h3>
<p>Ann Putnam, Jr., Marcy Lewis, Abigail Williams, Mary Walcott 
    and Elizabeth Hubbard accused Giles Corey of witchcraft in April of 1692. 
    He pleaded "not guilty" but refused to be tried by the court which, in his 
    view, had already determined his guilt, so he stood mute rather "putting himself 
    on the country." He was sentenced to peine forte et dure, even though 
    it was an illegal punishment, and ended up being torturously crushed to death 
    on (or before) September 18, 1692. One of the major factors which made Giles 
    Corey a prime target was not only his relationship with the rest of the community 
    but also his past encounters with the law, including a prior conviction for 
    murder. His chosen means of resistance and dramatic death reveal a strength 
    of character that playwrights, from Longfellow to Arthur Miller, have found 
    irresistible.

<h3>
			Giles Corey
		</h3>
<p>By Heather Snyder</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Born in England about 1611, Giles Corey was one of the six men to be executed during the
			Salem witch trials of 1692. John Proctor, George Burroughs, George Jacobs Sr., John
			Willard, and Samuel Wardwell were all hanged after being convicted of witchcraft, while
			Giles Corey was pressed to death with stones for refusing to "put himself on the
			country," that is, to allow himself to be put on trial. He emigrated from England to
			Salem and remained there until 1659 when he relocated to Salem Farms, just south of
			Salem Village. There he owned an extensive plot of land, which resulted in the
			appearance of his being a prosperous farmer. His personality, reputation and
			relationships with others however tainted that picture. Although he had become a full
			member of the Village church and had close ties with the Porter faction in the Village,
			his reputation as one who lacked consideration for others in the community and as one
			who lead a "scandalous life," quite possibly had a significant impact on his being
			accused as a witch. Because of Corey's previous encounters with the law, there was
			further suspicion of his guilt during the witch trials. In 1675, Corey pummeled and
			killed a farm worker named Jacob Goodale. He was found guilty of the murder and ordered
			to pay a substantial fine.</p>
<p>By the time of the trials, Giles Corey was already 80, and was married to Martha, his
			third wife. On March 19, 1692, Martha was arrested for witchcraft. Giles, for reasons
			unknown to others, decided to testify against his wife, but eventually tried to recant
			his deposition, which lead to greater suspicion of his involvement in witchcraft because
			of the stigma surrounding perjury. One month later, on April 19, 1692, Giles Corey was
			accused of witchcraft and there was a warrant out for his arrest. There were two primary
			accusations, one from Abigail Hobbs who during her own confession to witchcraft named
			Giles and Martha Corey as fellow witches, and one from Exekiell Chevers and John Putnam,
			Jr., who filed an accusation on behalf of Ann Putnam, Marcy Lewis, Abigail Williams,
			Mary Walcott and Elizabeth Hubbard.</p>
<p>After his arrest, Giles Corey remained in jail with his wife until his trial on September
			16, 1692. He went to the trial and pleaded "not guilty" but simultaneously refused to
			"put himself on the court" because of his contempt for the court. Corey was not willing
			to submit himself to a trial by jury that, he believed, had already determined his
			guilt. Because the court had accepted the testimony of the same accusers in a trial on
			September 9, and in all previous trials, Giles understood that there was no chance of
			being found not guilty and that a conviction would be inevitable. In every previous
			trial when an accused individual had plead not guilty, not a single person was cleared
			so Giles preferred to undergo "what Death they would put him to" rather than be found
			guilty of witchcraft and thus put to death. According to English law, Giles was ruled as
			"standing mute" because he would not be tried by "God and my country." The Court of Oyer
			and Terminer strictly adhered to the requirement that a defendant "put himself on the
			country". Because Giles stood mute, he was given the dreaded sentence of peine forte et
			dure even though this procedure had been determined to be illegal by the government of
			Massachusetts. It was illegal for two reasons: there was no law permitting pressing, and
			it violated the Puritan provisions of the Body of Liberties regarding the end of
			barbarous punishment. In the entire history of the United States, Giles Corey is the
			only person ever to be pressed to death by order of a court.</p>
<p>There is a strong local tradition Giles Corey refused trial in order to avoid a
			conviction that would result in the forfeiture of his property to the government. Under
			English and Massachusetts law, however, conviction could not result in the forfeiture of
			an estate. However, the George Corwin, the Sheriff of Essex Country illegally seized the
			property of some of those arrested for witchcraft. Before his arrest, Corey himself was
			clearly concerned about his extensive estate, and he wrote a will that deeded his land
			to his sons-in-law William Cleeves and John Moulton. The laws clearly stated that
			landowners retained the right to give their land to their heirs rather than forfeit it
			because of a conviction, and apparently Corey knew it. Thus it does not seem likely that
			Corey refused to go on trial to save his property.</p>
<p>On or before September 18, 1692, Giles Corey was slowly pressed to death in the field
			next to the jail. In the literature about Giles Corey's tortuous death, there is
			reference to his famous last words, "more weight." These words were uttered as a final
			attempt to expedite his death while also showing that not even imminent death could
			convince him to go to trial. It is even told that the Sheriff took his cane and pressed
			Giles' tongue back into his mouth just before he died at the end of the two days of
			being slowly crushed. On September 18, 1692, Giles Corey was ex-communicated from the
			Village church so that he would not die as a member of the church. On September 21,
			1692, Martha, his wife, was hanged on Gallows Hill. It has been speculated that the
			publicity surrounding the pressing of Giles may have in fact helped to build public
			opposition to the witchcraft trials.</p>
<p>In Arthur Miller's, The Crucible, Giles Corey is a prominent character in part because of
			his unique role in the witch trials. Giles' colorful past, his willingness to be
			tortured before compromising his own values, and his role in his wife's conviction are
			the factors which make him such a vibrant character. Although Millers' presentation of
			Giles Corey in The Crucibleis not purely historical, his place in the witch trials will
			never be forgotten. Giles Corey did in fact testify against his wife in front of the
			court, and he seems to have stood mute as an act of dramatic defiance. Henry W.
			Longfellow's Giles Corey of Salem Farms is another piece of literature that portrays
			Giles Corey in a strong and powerful manner. In his play, Corey's character is defined
			by his last conversation with his friend Capt. Richard Gardner. In the play, Giles Corey
			says: "I will not plead. If I deny, I am condemned already, in courts where ghosts
			appear as witnesses, and swear men's lives away. If I confess, then I confess to a lie,
			to buy a life which is not a life, but only death in life. I will not bear false witness
			against any, Not even against myself, whom I count least...I come! Here is my body; ye
			may torture it, but the immortal soul ye cannot crush!"</p>
<p>This passage shows why the character of Giles Corey attracts attention not only when
			examining court documents from 1692 but also the present day literature. Giles Corey
			will be remembered unambiguously in literature and history because of his act of supreme
			defiance to the Salem witch trials.</p>

<h3>Martha Cory</h3>
<p> The accusation of Martha Corey marked a turning point in the Salem witch trials crisis of 1692 in Massachusetts. 
        
        Corey was a newly accepted member of the village church and broke the established mold of only social pariahs being
        
        accused of practicing witchcraft. Major contributing factors to the case being brought against her were an illegitimate son 
        
        born to Corey in the 1670s, and her outspoken criticisms of the trials and the judges involved in the convictions. Although 
        
        Martha espoused her innocence throughout her whole ordeal, she was put to death on September 22, 1692.

<h3>
			Martha Cory
		</h3>
<p>Written by Jillian Smith and Eliza Pollack</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring semester 2002, Fall Semester 2006</p>
<p>In 1692, the small town of Salem, Massachusetts was wracked by terror and confusion. By
			March, accusations and convictions of witches and witchcraft had reached a high point,
			and it seemed like no one was safe from the madness. In late February, Elizabeth Parris
			and Abigail Williams had named Tituba, Sarah Goode, and Sarah Osborne. These three women
			seemed to fit a kind of stereotypical pattern. They were perceived by many as social
			outcasts, misfits, and were not members of the church. On March 11, 1692, this pattern
			took a drastically different turn, however. Under the pressure of Reverend Samuel
			Parris, the two girls accused Goodwife Martha Corey, a new but universally accepted good
			member of the Salem church; to some, she was even known as the "gospel woman." Citizens
			of Salem were shocked at this fourth accusation, and while no one questioned either
			Elizabeth or Abigail on their indictment, eyebrows were certainly raised when Martha
			Corey was asked to testify in court on March 22, 1692. </p>
<p>Martha Corey's active church participation and religious faith were genuine, but her
			history was not as pure. Over twenty years earlier, Corey had given birth to an
			illegitimate son whom she named Benoni. Benoni was thought to be mulatto and was living
			proof of Corey's indiscriminate past. Because the boy lived with Corey and her husband,
			Giles, town members were completely aware of her situation, and it is likely that this
			was one factor that played into the afflicted girls' accusation. After being accused,
			Martha made a concerted effort to dispel the rumors that she was a witch, and cited her
			religious fervor as proof that she could never support nor believe in the devil. In her
			book, In the Devil's Snare, however, author Mary Beth Norton makes the point that
			Martha's "acceptance into the church, given her personal background and the exclusivity
			of church membership in Salem Village, must have set tongues wagging. On at least one
			other occasion in seventeenth-century New England, the admission to church membership of
			a woman with a checkered sexual past fomented an uproar among her neighbors. The same
			could well have happened in the case of Martha Corey, causing speculation about the
			validity of her reputed adherence to Christianity (Norton, page 46)." </p>
<p>A second contributing factor, perhaps even more important than her illegitimate son, was
			Corey's vehement, and public, denunciations of the witch trials and the judges involved
			in hearings. From the beginning, Corey was skeptical about even the existence of
			witches. In an encounter with a member of the Putnam family, Martha stated that she "did
			not think there were any witches" in New England and believed that she could" open the
			eyes of the church to the truth about non-existence of the devil himself. Corey was also
			critical of the afflicted girls themselves. During her trial, she asked that the judges
			not believe the actions of the girls, and made similar claims throughout the Salem
			crisis as a whole. This fact combined with her questionable past made her an easy target
			for the afflicted girls. By accusing her, the Putnams demonstrated that they would
			willingly attack anyone who openly questioned their motives and authority. </p>
<p>In their book Salem Possessed, Paul Boyer and Stephan Nissenbaum make a third argument
			for why Martha Corey was accused of witchcraft. By 1692, the Putnam family had fallen on
			social and economic hardship, and its members were looking for people to blame for their
			essential fall from grace. Two easy targets of their anger were Mary Veren Putnam and
			Joseph Putnam, the stepmother and half-brother of Thomas Putnam and his siblings. The
			ideal revenge would be to accuse both of witchcraft; for various reasons, however,
			including the perceived social power of Mary and Joseph and their familial ties, the
			Putnams never brought cases against them. Instead, they focused their attention on
			less-threatening targets, like Martha Corey. Indeed, Boyer and Nissenbaum believe that
			the Putnams projected their anger and dissatisfaction with Mary onto Martha: "The
			accusation of…Corey was a key point along the psychological progression which the Thomas
			Putnam family, and the entire witchcraft episode, followed in 1692…In turning on [Corey]
			they betrayed the fact that witchcraft accusations against the powerless, the outcast,
			or the already victimized were not sufficiently cathartic for them. They were driven to
			last out at persons of real respectability – persons, in short, who reminded them of the
			individuals actually responsible (so they believed) for their own reduced fortunes and
			prospects…Corey was the ideal transition figure: she combined respectability with a
			touch of deviance. If the Putnams could bring her down, they would be free, not only
			politically, but psychologically as well, to play out their compulsions on a still
			larger scale (Boyer and Nissenbaum, page 146-147)." </p>
<p>On March 21, 1692, Corey was forced to testify on her innocence in court. When asked by
			Judge Hathorne why she "hurt" "these persons," Corey responded, "I never had to do with
			Witchcraft since I was born. I am a Gospell Woman." When urged to confess to her crimes,
			Corey said that if she was guilty, she would admit it; but she maintained that she was
			an innocent woman throughout the entirety of the trials. No matter what she said on the
			stand, Corey realized the futility of her efforts and told Hathorne and the community:
			"Ye are all against me&amp; I cannot help it." Corey, like the other accused witches,
			was involved in a battle against the dramatic performances of the afflicted, and
			determined, young women. It was truly her word against the testimonies of others,
			telling similar stories to Edward Putnam, who spoke on behalf of Ann Putnam, Jr., saying
			that Corey "desired to come and see his daughter Ann Putnam: who had charged Martha Cory
			to her face…but no sooner did Martha Cory come into the house of Thomas Putnam but Ann
			Putnam fell ill in grievous fits." Martha's sense of desperation could not have proved
			to be any truer. On September 22 of the same year, Martha Corey was hung to death in
			Salem. She was one of nineteen men and women killed during the witchcraft crisis. </p>
<p>The accusation and conviction of Martha Corey marked a turning point in the Salem witch
			crisis. Corey was a well-liked, accepted, and covenanted member of the church who was
			socially and economically stable. Her past sexual indiscretions, combined with her
			opposition to the trials and the personal vendettas of the Putnam family, however, all
			made her a fairly easy target for the afflicted girls. Martha Corey opened the door for
			anyone to be accused of witchcraft. She removed all of the social boundaries and led the
			way for over one hundred more men and women to be accused of cavorting with the devil in
			Massachusetts. </p>

<h3>
			Mary Easty
		</h3>
<p>Written By Anne Taite Austin</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Considering the assumption that witchcraft was hereditary, Mary (Towne) Easty was certain
			to be accused of witchcraft after her sister, Rebecca (Towne) Nurse, was condemned for
			her unwavering appeal of innocence. Mary Easty was not a member of Salem Town or
			Village, but a resident of Topsfield, a settlement just north of the Village. Animosity
			had festered between members of Salem Village and Topsfield since 1639 when the General
			Court of Massachusetts granted Salem permission to expand northward in the direction of
			the Ipswich River, but then only four years later the same court authorized inhabitants
			of another Village, Ipswich, to found a settlement there. As land became scarcer,
			quarrels regarding boundaries between the settlement to become known as Topsfield and
			Salem went on for a century. The Putnams of Salem Village embodied this battle in their
			quarrels with the Nurse family, Mary Easty's brother-in-law. According to Boyer and
			Nissenbaum in Salem Possessed, considering the bitterness between these families, it can
			be seen as no coincidence that the three Towne sisters, Rebecca Nurse, Sarah Cloyce and
			Mary Easty, were all daughters and wives of Topsfield men eventually to be persecuted by
			Putnam women in 1692 on behalf of Putnam men.</p>
<p>More interesting than the accusations against Easty is her experience during the trials.
			She was accused on April 21, examined on the 22nd, and imprisoned after denying her
			guilt. During her examination, Magistrate John Hathorne aggressively questioned Easty,
			or more accurately, tried to lead her to a confession by the following line of
			questioning:</p>
<p>"How can you say you know nothing when you see these tormented [girls], &amp; accuse you
			that you know nothing?" "Would you have me accuse myself?"</p>
<p>"Yes if you be guilty."</p>
<p>"Sir, I never complied but prayed against [the devil] all my dayes... I will say it, if
			it was my last time, I am clear of this sin." (SWPI 120)</p>
<p>In a surprising moment, Hathorne, clearly affected by the convincing manner with which
			Easty spoke, turned to the accusers and asked, "Are you certain this is the woman?" This
			question acted as a symbol for the accusers to release their full energy into tormented
			fits. Hathorne was now convinced and imprisoned Easty. The girls, however, seemed not to
			be fully convinced of their own accusations. Perhaps due to pressure from community
			around Easty, all of the accusers, except Mercy Lewis, began to back off their claims
			and Easty was released from jail on May 18.</p>
<p>The details of what happened next provide undeniable clues about the power of the
			accusers and the impossibility of conducting a fair juridical process. After Easty's
			release, Mercy Lewis fell into violent fits and appeared to be approaching death. Mercy
			Lewis later explained that Easty was tormenting her, and "said [Easty] would kill
			[Lewis] before midnight because she did not cleare hir so as the Rest did." (Salem
			Witchcraft Papers, I: 124) Mary Walcott, Abigail Williams and Ann Putnam were brought to
			her bedside in an effort to discover who was tormenting Mercy. Along the path to the
			Mercy's house, Ann and Abigail explained that they saw Easty's specter tormenting Mercy,
			strongly suggesting a collaboration effort had already taken place before Mercy began
			her torments. Frances Hill in A Delusion of Satan calls this episode a propaganda scheme
			to show doubting Villagers the dire consequences of freeing witches from jail. Mercy and
			four others cried out against Easty on May 20. Mercy's fits did not cease until Easty
			was back in prison in irons demonstrating the effective power of the accusers.</p>
<p>While Easty remained in jail awaiting her September 9 trial, she and her sister, Sarah
			Cloyce, composed a petition to the magistrates in which they asked, in essence, for a
			fair trial. They complained that they were "neither able to plead our owne cause, nor is
			councell allowed." They suggested that the judges ought to serve as their counsel and
			that they be allowed persons to testify on their behalf. Easty hoped her good reputation
			in Topsfield and the words of her minister might aid her case in Salem, a town of
			strangers. Lastly, the sisters asked that the testimony of accusers and other "witches"
			be dismissed considering it was predominantly spectral evidence that lacked legality.
			(Salem Witchcraft Papers, I: 303) The sisters hoped that the judges would be forced to
			weigh solid character testimony against ambiguous spectral evidence. The petition did
			not change the outcome of Easty's trial, for she was condemned to hang on September
			17th. But together with her second petition, Easty had forced the court to consider its
			flaws.</p>
<p>Easty's second petition was written not as a last attempt to save her own life but as a
			plea that "no more innocent blood may be shed." (SWP I :304) She concedes saying that
			the court had the best of intentions, but only more innocent deaths would occur if the
			court continued its practices, for she like many others could not "belie [their] own
			soul." She proposes two strategies for the court in to use when determining witchcraft:
			First, she asks that the accusers be kept apart to see if under such circumstances they
			would all tell the same experiences. If they were able to give similar credible accounts
			of their spectral experiences then any doubt would be removed as to the guilt or
			innocence of the person on trial. This proposal brings to mind Thomas Brattle's
			observation in his famous Letter of October 8, 1692 that the accusers, when not claiming
			to be attacked by specters, were otherwise in good health. Easty was obviously not the
			only skeptic of the accusers' spectral torments. Secondly, Easty proposed that all
			confessing witches be brought to trial as well as those confessing innocence. Rosenthal
			writes in A Salem Story that in an atmosphere of rising doubt, "for the court to ignore
			Easty's challenge would be to acknowledge to the critics that the proceedings were
			fatally flawed - that the hunt was not really for witches after all but for validating
			the court."</p>
<p>Easty was hanged on September 22, 1692. Her demeanor at Gallows Hill is documented by
			Calef: "when she took her last farewell of her husband, children and friends, was, as is
			reported by them present, as serious, religious, distinct, and affectionate as could
			well be exprest, drawing tears from the eyes of almost all present." Easty challenged
			the court to no personal avail, but she exposed the weakness of the court for the
			benefit of others.</p>

<h3>Sarah Good</h3>
<p>
    Sarah Good was born to a prosperous innkeeper in 1653. However, her father's 
    estate became entangled in litigation leaving Sarah Good in poverty. After 
    the death of her first husband, she married William Good. The Goods lived 
    a life of begging and poverty in Salem Village. Sarah was regarded as an unsavory 
    person and has come to be regarded through literature as the stereotypical 
    witch, a disreputable old hag. Good was among the first three women accused 
    of witchcraft in 1692 and was the first to testify. She never confessed guilt, 
    but, like Tituba, she did accuse Sarah Osburne, an act that was credited with 
    validating the witchcraft trials and accusations. Good was hanged as a witch 
    on Tuesday July 19, 1692, but not until after the imprisonment of her six 
    year old child Dorcas, also accused of witchcraft, and the tragic death of 
    her infant in prison.

<h3>
			Sarah Good
		</h3>
<p>Written By Sara Jobe</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Sarah Good was born in 1653 to a well off innkeeper named John Solart. However, her
			father's estate was tied up in litigation that left Good virtually nothing. Her first
			marriage was to a poor indentured servant named Daniel Poole who died in debt in 1686.
			Her second marriage to William Good was doomed from the outset because the couple had to
			pay for the debts of first husband Poole. The Goods were homeless, renting rooms in
			other people's houses, and they had two young children. William worked as a laborer
			around Salem Village in exchange for food and lodging, but it became increasingly
			difficult for the family to find a place to stay as Sarah's reputation for and being
			socially unpleasant spread throughout the town. The family was regarded as a nuisance to
			the town, and by 1692 they were virtually beggars.</p>
<p>Good's position as a disreputable and marginal member of society made her a perfect
			candidate for witchcraft accusations. On February 29, 1692, the first warrant was issued
			for the arrest of Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba. The three were accused
			initially of afflicting Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, and later many other accusers
			came forward to testify about injurious actions and spectral evidence against Good. Good
			was the first to testify in the Salem Witchcraft trials, and Bernard Rosenthal in Salem
			Story asserts that Good was specifically chosen to start the trials off because most
			people were in support of ridding Salem Village of her presence. Even her six-year-old
			daughter Dorcas was frightened into testifying against her, and although her husband did
			not call her a witch, he said that he, too, had reason to believe she was close to
			becoming one, thus, perhaps, protecting himself from accusation. One of Good's trial
			records quotes William Good as saying, "it was her bad carriage to [me] and indeed say I
			with tears that she is enemy to all good." Despite the overwhelming sentiment against
			her, Good adamantly denied Magistrate John Hathorne's accusations. When Hathorne in the
			pre-trial hearings asked, "Why do you hurt these children?" Good responded, "I do not
			hurt them. I scorn it." She also stated repeatedly, "I am falsely accused."</p>
<p>Although Good never confessed, she did accuse Sarah Osborne of afflicting the girls after
			witnessing the accusers fall down in fits in the courtroom. Historians generally agree
			that this accusation by Good was one of the first and strongest legitimizations of the
			witchcraft trials. Only one person came forth to defend Good. When one of the girls
			accused Good of stabbing her with a knife and produced a broken knife tip to prove it, a
			man came forward showing that it was his knife from which the tip had been broken in the
			presence of the accusing girl. Far from invalidating the girl's testimony against Good,
			Judge Stoughton simply asked the girl to continue with her accusations with a reminder
			to stick to the facts.</p>
<p>Good was condemned to hang but was pardoned until the birth of her child. Her daughter
			Dorcas was accused of witchery and was imprisoned for over seven months. Although the
			child of six years was eventually released on bond, she was psychologically damaged for
			the rest of her life. Good's infant died in prison with her before Good was hanged. Her
			execution occurred on Tuesday July 19, 1692. According to local tradition, when Good
			stood at the gallows prepared to die she was asked once more by Rev. Nicholas Noyes,
			assistant minister in the Salem church, to confess and thus save her immortal soul. Far
			from confessing, Good is said to have screamed, "You're a liar! I'm no more a witch than
			you are a wizard! If you take my life away, God will give you blood to drink!" It was
			this constant refusal to confess that Bernard Rosenthal believes led Good to the
			Gallows, even more so than all of the accusations against her.</p>
<p>The way in which Good has been portrayed in literature is worth mentioning because it
			sheds light upon how the Salem Witch Trials have been popularly imagined and how the
			accused witches were and are viewed today. Good is always depicted as an old hag with
			white hair and wrinkled skin. She is often said to be sixty or seventy years of age by
			the same writers who clearly state that she was pregnant and had a six-year-old
			daughter. Even accounts from Salem Villagers and magistrates at the time refer to her as
			an old nuisance, hag, and bed-ridden. How did such a misconception arise? Perhaps her
			hard life did have such a physical effect on Good that she did appear extremely aged. On
			the other hand, witches are described in literature then and now as being old wicked
			women. If Good was to represent the typical witch worthy of execution, then it is not
			surprising that all of the stereotypes would be accordingly attached. Good was a
			marginal woman and no doubt a nuisance to her neighbors. However, the Salem trials were
			conducted unfairly, with a presumption of guilt, and little evidence. Marginality is not
			worthy of hanging, and Good was never proved to be nor did she confess to be a
			witch.</p>

<h3>George Jacobs, Sr.</h3>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was about 72 years old when he was hanged 
    as a wizard on August 19, 1692, along with three other men and one woman -- 
    the first time men were executed for witchcraft in Salem. He was accused, 
    among many others, by his granddaughter, Margaret Jacobs who was also accused 
    and imprisoned. Depending on scholarly opinion, he has been seen as the victim 
    of personal grudges, the casualty of the socio-political climate of Salem, 
    or the target of cultural system's effects on young, socially subordinate 
    women. </p>

<p>The painting depicts the trial of George Jacobs, Sr. at the Court of Oyer and
				Terminer in Salem. The scene is an imaginary one, as no records of the actual trial
				exist, and it its not known who was present at Jacobs' trial on August 5th. The
				inspiration for the painting comes from two moving documents written by 17year-old
				Margaret Jacobs: "Margaret Jacobs to her Father" and
				"Recantation of Margaret Jacobs." See
				</p>
<p>In addition to the officials of the court, Matteson portrays several members of
				the George Jacobs family who became caught up in the witchcraft accusations in Salem
				Village. Kneeling in the foreground is the white haired, 72 year-old George Jacobs,
				Sr., wearing an expensive red cape, with his walking stick lying next to him on the
				floor. At the center of the picture, pointing her finger directly at Jacobs, is his
				granddaughter Margaret Jacobs. Urged to confess to witchcraft to save her life, she
				accused her grandfather among others who had already been accused. The distraught
				figure lunging towards Margaret is her mother Rebecca Jacobs, who was said to have
				been mentally deranged at the time. She, too, was accused of witchcraft. Standing
				next to George Jacobs, Sr. is his son, George Jacobs, Jr., whom Matteson shows
				responding in horror to his daughter's accusation of her grandfather. In the
				foreground, Matteson places a young man and a girl suffering from
				"fits," caused by George Jacobs senior's invisible
				"specter." The girl is possibly Sarah Churchill, Jacobs' household
				servant, or perhaps Ann Putnam, both of whom repeatedly testified that Jacobs'
				specter attacked them.  The black robed magistrates are shown at the bench,
				with the chief magistrate, William Stoughton, towing over the commotion caused by
				Margaret's accusation of her grandfather. One of the magistrates, perhaps John
				Hathorne, who often took the lead role in interrogating the accused in court, holds
				a written document, in front of the young Margaret Jacobs. This document may be
				intended to represent Margaret's written confession in which she accuses her
				grandfather. Judge Hathorne gestures towards the clerk of the court, Stephen Sewall,
				who is shown writing down Margaret's testimony at the clerk's table, with the other
				court records lying in front of him . In the background against the windows Matteson
				shows a group of people who may represent the grand jury. The artist also depicts
				the large crowd of onlookers that typically attended the trials in Salem. </p>

<h3>
			George Jacobs, Sr.
		</h3>
<p>Written By Kristin Buckstad</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was born ca. 1620. Not much is known about when he came to
			Massachusetts Bay Colony, or about his first wife. He had three children from his first
			marriage, all born in Salem. George Jr. (b. ca. 1649), Mary (b. ca. 1650), and Ann (b.
			ca. 1655). He bought land in Salem around 1658 and married his second wife, Mary, about
			1673. He had lived in Salem for a little over thirty years when he was accused of
			witchcraft.</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was arrested on May 10, 1692, along with his granddaughter Margaret
			Jacobs. He was examined twice, on the day of his arrest and on the following day. His
			trial took place in early August, and he remained in prison from the time of his arrest
			until his execution on August 19.</p>
<p>His primary accuser was Sarah Churchill, who was a servant in his home. She came from a
			wealthy family of English gentry in Maine but was most likely orphaned in Indian Wars.
			She, like Margaret, had been accused of witchcraft and, in her confession, accused
			others. George Jacobs granddaughter Margaret herself confessed to witchcraft and accused
			her grandfather among others who had already been accused in order, she wrote, "to save
			my life and to have my liberty." The list of accusers against Jacobs did not end there.
			It swelled to include Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam, Mercy Lewis, Elizabeth Hubbard, Mary
			Walcott, Sarah Bibber, Mary Warren, Joseph Flint, Thomas Putnam, John Putnam, Jr., and
			John DeRich.</p>
<p>The women accused his Jacobs' specter of beating them with his walking stick and other
			physical abuses. Not only did the women testify that Jacobs afflicted them, they also
			testified to witnessing the afflictions of the others. During his testimony, John
			DeRich, a sixteen-year old boy, was the only person to claim that Jacobs afflicted him.
			The Putnam men testified that they witnessed the afflictions that Mary Walcott and the
			other women suffered on May 11 at the hands of Jacobs' specter.</p>
<p>The Puritans believed that witches and wizards had proof of their covenants with the
			Devil on their bodies. Doctor George Herrick was sent to examine Jacobs' body for the
			witch's "teat," and found one on his right shoulder. This slight protuberance on his
			skin combined with the spectral evidence made the case strong enough for indictment.</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. emerges as an interesting person from the records of his examinations
			on May 10 and 11. He was incredulous from the moment the first accuser, Abigail
			Williams, cried out against him. He laughed in court, always a risky response and said:
			"Because I am falsely accused.-Your worships all of you do think this is true?" One of
			his most famous protest was the defiant assertion, "You tax me for a wizard, you may as
			well tax me for a buzzard I have done no harm." Emphatically portraying his unwavering
			Christian faith, he declared, "Well: burn me, or hang me, I will stand in the truth of
			Christ, I know nothing of it." Several times he argued that "The Devill can go in any
			shape" or "can take any likeness." This was sound theological doctrine at the time,
			warning the court that it was doing the Devil's work by accusing innocent people. The
			judges, however, believed that the Devil cannot take a person's form "without [his]
			consent."</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was then indicted, tried, and found guilty of witchcraft. He was
			hanged on August 19, 1692 with George Burroughs, John Proctor, John Willard, and Martha
			Carrier. This was the first time men were executed as witches in Salem. Meanwhile,
			Jacobs' granddaughter Margaret Jacobs was free from danger after confessing and accusing
			her grandfather but remained in jail. Her father, George Jacobs, Jr., was also accused
			but fled from Salem Town. When he did so, he left behind his wife, Rebecca, in jail
			facing witchcraft charges. She became severely emotionally disturbed and was most likely
			ruled mentally incompetent and escaped conviction. George Sr.'s second wife, Mary,
			survived him and remarried on June 23, 1693 to John Wilds whose wife had been hanged as
			a witch on July 19, 1692. Jacobs body was retrieved from Gallows Hill by his family and
			buried on his land. In the 1980's his body had to be moved quickly, due to the sale of
			the Jacobs family property,. His bones were kept in storage in the Danvers Archive until
			1992 when he was finally put to rest in the Rebecca Nurse Cemetery.</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr.'s role in the witch trials has been interpreted in several ways.
			Bernard Rosenthal views him as the victim of fabrication. For example, Ann Putnam and
			Abigail Williams knowingly put pins in their hands and accused his specter of putting
			them there to add to evidence against him (Salem Story). He was also a victim of the
			life-saving strategy that the accused learned during the early course of the trials:
			confess and your life will be spared. Two of his primary accusers were among the accused
			who confessed to save themselves..</p>
<p>Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum interpret the trials in socio-economic and political
			terms. They argue that many members of the more rural and agricultural Salem Village
			(e.g. the Putnam family) were threatened by those with economic and political
			connections to Salem Town (e.g. the Porter family), the seaport and center of emerging
			capitalism. Salem Village had been trying to assert its independence from the Town by
			establishing its own church, and inhabitants of the Village with ties to the Town were
			seen as threats to the cause of Village independence. As such, the majority of accusers
			was from the Village and the majority of the accused who lived on the western side of
			the Village nearer to the Town. George Jacobs, Sr.'s son, George, was good friend of the
			Porters, making the family vulnerable to accusations, particularly from the Putnams. The
			phenomenon of the accused becoming accusers was due, they argue, to the swarm of
			accusations made in the heat of politics and economics. Eventually the confusion had to
			fall back on itself.</p>
<p>Carol Karlsen offers a more gender-oriented analysis. The "possessed accusers" were
			usually subordinate members of society such as servants. Many of them, like Sarah
			Churchill, were orphans. Their prospects for improving their social standings were
			virtually nonexistent since they had no families and no dowries to support them. Totally
			dependent upon the will of others, their discontent and anxiety would have been quite
			marked. Puritan society, however, did not tolerate socially aggressive and assertive
			women. Their fears were then converted, psychologically, into the belief that they were
			either witches or were possessed. After all, Carol Karlsen argues, a society that
			teaches the existence of possession will invariably contain persons who think they are
			possessed and are believed to be so by others. As for the specific reason that Sarah
			Churchill accused George Jacobs, he may have been seen as a tormentor or harsh master
			since most of the accusations contained charges of physical abuse.</p>
<p>All of these explanations fall short, however. None of them explains why Jacobs own
			granddaughter would accuse him of all people or why such a large number of accusations
			flew at Jacobs, except for the fact that he publicly denounced the circle of "afflicted"
			girls, thus opening them to charges of fraud and compliance with the Devil. If modern
			students and scholars find it hard to explain why so many people would spend their time
			accusing a 70 year-old man, it is quite easy to see why George Jacobs, Sr. laughed and
			told the judges that he could not believe this was happening.</p>

<h3>Susannah Martin</h3>
<p>The sixty-seven year old widow Susannah Martin of Amesbury was 
    hanged as a witch on July 19, 1692 on the basis of the testimony of the accusing 
    circle of girls of Salem Village and other neighbors. Although she maintained 
    her innocence to the end, a previous history of witchcraft accusations and 
    the momentum of Salem's accusations carried her to the gallows. Martin figures 
    in historian Carol Karlsen's account of the Salem outbreak as an example of 
    a woman who was easily targeted as a threat to the orderly transmission of 
    property down the paternal line because of Martin's role in an ongoing court

			Susannah Martin
		</h3>
<p>Written By Kate Murphy</p>
<p> Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Maintaining her innocence up until the moment of her execution, Susannah North Martin was
			hanged with four other women on July 19, 1692 during the outbreak of witchcraft
			accusations in Salem. At the time of her execution Martin was 67 and a widow. She
			arrived in Massachusetts in 1621 from Buckinghamshire, England, married the blacksmith
			George Martin in Salisbury, in 1646 and had eight children. During the course of her
			examination and trial 15 of Martin's neighbors accused her of afflicting them through
			her specter, by pinching them or causing their farm animals to die. The Reverend Cotton
			Mather believed her to be "one of the most impudent, scurrilous, wicked Creatures in the
			World" Brave and outspoken, Martin refused to allow her accusers to shake her
			convictions. Standing in the courtroom, confronted by girls seemingly writhing from
			"afflictions" they blamed on her, Martin maintained that she only "desire[d] to lead my
			self according to the word of God." Asked what she then made of the afflicted girls, she
			courageously suggested that they might be the ones under the devil's influence,
			reminding the judges that, "He [the devil] that appeared in the sam[e] shape a glorifyed
			saint can appear in any ones shape." Her vehement denials made no difference; the court
			only took her defiance as proof of her reprobate character.</p>
<p>Martin was no stranger to witchcraft accusations, having been accused two decades
			earlier. Her husband, deceased by the time of the Salem outbreak, had countered the
			charges of witchcraft and infanticide with slander suites. Although he did not win
			decisively, Susannah was acquitted in the criminal courts. In public gossip, however,
			her reputation as a witch appears to have continued irrespective of the court's
			findings.</p>
<p>At the same time as the first accusations of witchcraft Susannah and her husband were
			involved in a series of legal battles over her inheritance. In 1688 her father, Richard
			North, died leaving two daughters, a granddaughter and his second wife to share his
			sizable estate. To the surprise of Susannah and her sister, they received only a tiny
			portion while the bulk of the estate passed to his second wife, who died soon after her
			husband. Susannah's stepmother left the majority of North's estate to his granddaughter,
			continuing the exclusion of Susannah and her sister. From 1671 to 1674 Susannah's
			husband and her sister pursued a series of appeals, all of which were ultimately
			unsuccessful.</p>
<p>These familial disputes over inheritance were incorporated by historian Carol Karlsen in
			The Devil in the Shape of a Woman into her interpretation of the Salem outbreak in
			socio-economic terms. Karlsen postulated that accused witches were not only poor,
			disagreeable old women, but also women of social and economic standing within their
			community. Specifically, Karlsen believes there is a correlation between witchcraft
			accusations and aberrations in the traditional line of property transmission. She notes
			that property, particularly land, typically went to the male relatives after the death
			of a parent. In the cases of many of the accused women, however, Karlsen discovered a
			pattern of women standing to inherit in the absence of male heirs. She develops this
			theme, and Martin's place within her theory, in chapter three of her book. Although
			Karlsen's book offers invaluable insights in the role of gender in the Salem outbreak,
			in the case of Susannah Martin her theory stretches a bit too thin. The inheritance
			debate, which Karlsen cites as motivational for Martin's accusation, is separated from
			the Salem outbreak by twenty years. Much fresher in the minds of her accusers would be
			the outspokenness demonstrated by her comments during her courtroom examination. In this
			case, the accused fits very well with the stereotype of the accused witch as a
			disagreeable old woman.</p>
<p>Martin's descendant, John Greenleaf Whittier, immortalized her innocence and bravery in
			his poem The Witches Daughter, published in 1857. Referring to Martin's refusal to lie
			to save her life, Whittier wrote, "she whose speech was always truth's pure gold/Heard,
			not unpleased, its simple legends told." Painting the scene of a pious woman, ancient
			for her day at 67, passing the days in jail, Whittier imagined Martin "who turned, in
			Salem's dreary jail/Her worn old Bible o'er and o'er/When her dim eyes could read no
			more." This theme of upright innocence also characterizes the multiple web sites
			dedicated to the memory of Susannah Martin and maintained by her modern descendants (see
			www.rootsweb.com/~nwa/sm.html and www.homestead.com/loseegenealogy/snmartin.html).</p>

<h3>Rebecca Nurse</h3>
<p>Rebecca Nurse was an elderly and respected member of the Salem Village community. 
She was accused of witchcraft by several of the "afflicted" girls in 
the Village in March of 1692. Although a large number of friends, neighbors and 
family members wrote petitions testifying to her innocence, she was tried for 
acts of witchcraft in June, 1692. The jury first returned a "not guilty" 
verdict, but was told to reconsider, and then brought in a verdict of "guilty." 
Governor Phips pardoned her, but was later persuaded to reverse his decision by 
several men from Salem. She was excommunicated from the Salem church and hanged 
on July 19, 1692. Her house in Danvers, the former Salem village, still stands 
and is open to visitors. A large monument also marks her grave in the Nurse family 
cemetery on the grounds.

<b>Courtroom Exam</b><span class="expand" onclick="showHide(this)" title="expand">+</span>
<div style="display:none">
<h3>Rebecca Nurse</h3>
<p>Written by Matt Madden </p>
<p>Pre-Trial Examination: March 24, 1692</p>
<p>Rebecca Nurse, a sick and elderly woman of seventy-years old, stood for 
examination before the court on charges of practicing witchcraft on March 
24, 1692. Judge John Hathorne, assisted by Judge Jonathan Corwin, conducted 
the examination in the meeting house of Salem Village before a crowd of 
people from Salem Village. The examination of "Goody Nurse" developed 
into a spectacle worthy of the attendance of so many onlookers, as a number 
of afflicted women launched into "grevious fitts" and openly denounced 
Rebecca Nurse as the cause of their torment. In the end, after one of 
the great confrontations between an accused and the infamous Judge Hathorne, 
the Judges found cause to bind Rebecca Nurse over for trial after which 
she was executed on Gallows Hill on July 19, 1692.</p>
<p>The examination of Rebecca Nurse was recorded by the Reverend Samuel Parris, 
whose own young daughter Betty was one of the accusers together Betty's 
cousin, twelve-year old Abigail Williams. He writes that the examination 
opened with Hathorne turning his attention not to Nurse, but rather to 
Abigail Williams. Williams reported to the magistrates that the apparition 
of Nurse had just that morning, as well as on previous occasions, afflicted 
her. Shortly after this statement, Ann Putnam, Jr. launched into a "grievous 
fit" and before Rebecca Nurse even began to testify, the tone of the examination 
had been set.</p>
<p>Hathorne first turned his attention to Nurse, and pointedly asked her 
to account for the accusations of Williams and Putnam. Nurse, defiant 
and incredulous to the end, responded, "I can say before my Eternal Father 
I am innocent and God will clear my innocency." Following the first of 
many denials on Nurse's part, Hathorne turned his attention to the assembly 
to hear additional evidence against Nurse. After receiving two more accounts 
implicating Nurse in witchcraft, this time from adult men in the community, 
Hathorne put the question more directly. "Are you an innocent person relating 
to this witchcraft?" </p>
<p>Before Rebecca Nurse could respond, Ann Putnam, Sr. interrupted and cried 
out to Nurse, "Did you not bring the Black Man with you," and the examination 
descended into a barrage of accusations as Mary Walcott and Elizabeth 
Hubbard join in by crying out that Nurse afflicted them right there in 
the meeting house. </p>
<p>In an interesting aside in the examination record, Parris wrote that one 
of these accusations came from, "Mary Walcott (who often heretofore said 
she had seen her, but never could say or did say that she either bit or 
pinchted her, or hurt her)". Here, Parris, who actively encouraged the 
accusations in Salem Village, suggests that Walcott was now able to confirm 
that Nurse was the cause of her previous torment. Then the girls, with 
their eyes on Nurse's agitated movements, imitated her postures by contorting 
their own bodies. Thus they made it appear that Nurse implicated herself, 
as the afflicted cried out in pain with every movement of the examinant's 
head and arms, gaining the attion of the judges and the onlookers. Yet 
even in the face of this seemingly damning evidence, Nurse steadfastly 
proclaimed her innocence: "The Lord knows I have not hurt them. I am an 
innocent person." </p>
<p>The banter between Hathorne, and possibly at times Corwin, and Nurse continued 
as the judges attempted to badger a confession using different rhetorical 
devices. The judges asked why Nurse stood stoically in the face of such 
afflictions suffered by the girls, to which Nurse replied, "You do not 
know my heart," and that she was, "... as clear as the child unborn." 
The effort to force a confession is clear, as is the constant and unwavering 
refusal of Rebecca Nurse to "bely" herself by bearing false witness against 
herself, though at this early stage in the trials she could not know that 
confession was the way to buy time and avoid the gallows.. </p>
<p>Hathorne, likely frustrated at Nurse's refusal to cooperate and confess 
her dealings with the Devil, attempted a new approach. "They accuse you 
of hurting them," he stated, "and if you think it is not unwillingly but 
by designe, you must look upon them as murderers." The significance of 
this line runs deep. First, Hathorne by this statement deftly forced Nurse 
to explain the afflictions witnessed in that very room as, if not her 
fault, then the fault of the very girls so "grievously afflicted". Second, 
by stating that the afflicted girls would be "murderers" if merely pretending 
their affliction "by designe", it certainly became abundantly clear to 
Rebecca Nurse that it would be her own death to which these afflicted 
women would soon be responsible if they were lying, as executions had 
yet to be ordered or begun in Salem. It was Hathorne's final, desperate 
attempt to force a confession from Nurse by ensuring she understood that 
her own life was in the balance. </p>
<p>As the examination drew to a close, the best Hathorne could wrest from 
the steadfast Nurse was that though she did think the afflicted were "bewitcht", 
she stated that "I cannot help it, the Devil may appear in my shape." 
This small admission, made only after Hathorne had asserted that at least 
her apparition was culpable, still did not gain Hathorne full confession 
he wanted. Therefore, after an examination that was truly a circus hardly 
befitting a true and legal hearing, Judges Hathorne and Corwin bound Rebecca 
Nurse over for the trial which would result in her execution on charges 
of practicing witchcraft.</p>

<h3>"The Untold Story of Mary Ayer Parker: Gossip and Confusion in
			1692"</h3>
<p>Written by Jacqueline Kelly (copyright, 2005&gt;</p>
<p> History 209, An Undergraduate Course, Cornell University</p>
<p>Spring Semester, 2003</p>
<p>Revised for presentation at the Berkshire Conference, June, 2005</p>
<p>In September1692, Mary Ayer Parker of Andover came to trial in Salem Massachusetts,
			suspected of witchcraft. During her examination she was asked, "How long have ye been in
			the snare of the devil?" She responded, "I know nothing of it." Many people confessed
			under the pressure of the court of Oyer and Terminer, but she asserted they had the
			wrong woman. "There is another woman of the same name in Andover,"1 she proclaimed. At the time, no one paid much attention. Mary Ayer Parker
			was convicted and hanged by the end of the month. Modern historians have let her claim
			fall to the wayside as well, but what if she told the truth? Was there another Mary
			Parker in Andover? Could it be possible that the wrong Mary Parker was executed? We know
			little about the Mary Parker of 1692. Other scholars presumed her case was
			unimportant-but perhaps that assumption was wrong.</p>
<p>The end of her story is recorded for every generation to see, but the identity of this
			woman remained shrouded in mystery for over three centuries. We still don't know why she
			was accused in 1692. Puritan women were not particularly noteworthy to contemporary
			writers and record-keepers. They appeared occasionally in the court records as witnesses
			and plaintiffs but their roles were restricted to the house and family. Mary Parker was
			a typical Puritan wife. She appeared in the records only in birth notices and the
			records associated with the will of her late husband Nathan Parker. Notably, the records
			included no legal trouble at all, for witchcraft or anything else.</p>
<p>John and Hannah Ayer gave birth to their daughter Mary sometime in the early to mid
			1600's. Mary and her siblings may have been born in England, and later moved to North
			America with their parents. The Ayers moved several times during the early stages of
			their settlement in America but resettled for the last time in 1647 in Haverhill.2</p>
<p>The family was apparently of some prominence. Tax records from 1646 showed that John Ayer
			possessed at least one hundred and sixty pounds, making him one of the wealthiest
			settlers in Haverhill.</p>
<p>Mary Ayer married Nathan Parker sometime before her father's death in 1657. Although no
			marriage record survived in the hometowns of either Nathan or Mary, the wording of her
			father John Ayer's will made it obvious that she was married with children when it was
				written.3 Nathan married his first wife Susanna Short on
			November 20, 1648.4 Within the next three years, the couple
			relocated to Andover, where she soon after died on August 26, 1651.5 Andover's Vital Records listed the birth of Nathan and Mary Parker's first
			son John in 1653.6 Nathan could have remarried and had children
			within the two years after the death of his first wife.</p>
<p>Mary and Nathan marriage was not documented but we do know Nathan and his brother Joseph
			settled in Newbury, Massachusetts sometime in the early 1630's. They settled in Andover
			where they were amongst its first settlers.7 Nathan came over
			from England as an indentured servant8, but eventually he
			became rather wealthy in Andover. The original size of his house lot was four acres but
			the Parker's landholdings improved significantly over the years to 213.5 acres.9 His brother Joseph, a founding member of the Church, possessed
			even more land than his brother, increasing his wealth as a tanner.10 By 1660, there were forty household lots in Andover, and no more were
			created. The early settlers, including the Parkers, would be those of importance. By
			1650, Nathan began serving as a constable in Andover.11 By the
			time he married Mary Ayer, his status was on the rise. It continued to do so during the
			early years of their marriage as he acquired more land.</p>
<p>Mary and Nathan continued to have children for over twenty years after the birth of John
			Parker in 1653. Mary bore four more sons: James in 1655, Robert in 1665, Peter in 1676,
			and a son Joseph.12 She and Nathan also had four daughters:
			Mary, born in 1660 (or 1657)13, Hannah in 1659, Elizabeth in
			1663, and Sara in 1670. James died on June 29, 1677, killed in an Indian skirmish at
			Black Point.14 Robert died in 1688 at the age of 23. Hannah
			married John Tyler in 1682.15 Nathan and Mary's daughter
			Elizabeth married John Farnum in 1684.</p>
<p>When Nathan died on June 25, 1685, he left an ample estate to his wife and children.16 Mary Ayer Parker brought an inventory of the estate to court
			in September of the same year, totaling 463 pounds and 4 shillings. The court awarded
			her one-third of the house and lands, equal shares to Robert, Joseph, Peter, Hannah,
			Elizabeth, and Sarah, and a double share to John.17 Mary
			Parker widow obtained an estate of over 154 pounds-a good amount of money in the late
			seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Mary Parker did not appear in Essex County records after September 29, 1685 when she
			brought the inventory to court. We know little about her interaction with her neighbors
			and the community after her husband's death. The Parkers were a respectable family that
			continued to root itself in the community. So why, less than a decade after her
			husband's death, was Mary accused as a witch? There was no documented friction with any
			of her neighbors, any no prior accusations. The closest tie Mary had with witchcraft was
			a distant cousin on her father's side, William Ayers whose his wife Judith was accused
			of witchcraft in 1662.18 But this was not enough to justify
			Mary's accusation. What really happened in 1692 to Mary Ayer Parker?</p>
<p>The Salem crisis had spread to Andover when William Barker Jr. named her in his
			confession on September 1, 1692.19 He testified that "goode
			Parker went w'th him last Night to Afflict Martha Sprague." He elaborated that Goody
			Parker "rod upon a pole &amp; was baptized at 5 Mile pond," a common reference to a
			union made with the devil. The examination of Mary Parker occurred the next day. At the
			examination, afflicted girls from both Salem and Andover fell into fits when her name
			was spoken. The girls included Mary Warren, Sarah Churchill, Hannah Post, Sara Bridges,
			and Mercy Wardwell. The records state that when Mary came before the justices, the girls
			were cured of their fits by her touch-the satisfactory result of the commonly used
			"touch test," signifying a witch's guilt.20</p>
<p>When Mary denied being the witch they were after Martha Sprague, one of her accusers,
			quickly responded that is was for certain this Mary Parker, who had afflicted her.
			Sprague and Mary Lacy effectively fell into fits. Historian Mary Beth Norton discovered
			that Mary Parker was related to Sprague; she was Sprague's step-great-aunt.21 Mary Parker's son-in-law John Tyler's father Moses Tyler had
			married Martha's mother.22 Martha also lived in Andover, and
			the Tylers and the Parkers were friendly for sometime before their families were joined
			in marriage.23 Still, it was a distant relation and Martha was
			only sixteen years old at the time of the trial, so it is doubtful she knew Mary Parker
			personally.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mary Parker's defense was ignored, both by the courtroom, and most
			historians until now. However, Mary Ayer Parker told the truth: there was another Mary
			Parker living in Andover. In fact there were not one, but three other Mary Parkers in
			Andover. One was Mary Ayer's sister-in-law, Mary Stevens Parker, wife of Nathan's
			brother Joseph. The second was Joseph and Mary's daughter Mary. The third was the wife
			of Mary and Joseph's son, Stephen. Mary Marstone Parker married Stephen in 1680.24 To complicate things even further, there was yet another Mary
			Parker living nearby in Salem Towne.</p>
<p>Confusion could easily have arisen from the multitude of Mary Parkers abound in Essex
			County. However, similarities between Mary Ayer Parker and her sister-in-law may have
			instigated confusion in even her accusers. The two Mary's married the Parker brothers by
			the late 1640's, and began having children in the early 1650's. They had children of the
			same name including sons named Joseph and daughters Mary and Sara (Mary, daughter of
			Nathan and Mary may have died soon after her father 25).
			Nathan and Mary Parker's son James, born in 1655, and Joseph and Mary Parker's son John
			born in 1656, died on June 29, 1677, killed by the Indians at Black Point.26 In 1692, both Mary Parker Sr.'s were reasonably wealthy
			widows. Joseph's wife received their house and ample land from his will, dated November
			4, 1678.27 The two women shared almost fifty years of family
			ties. But in September of 1692, it was only Nathan Parker's wife who was accused, tried,
			and found guilty of witchcraft. Why was Mary Ayer brought to trial?</p>
<p>On the surface, the two Mary Parkers seemed almost interchangeable but the will of Joseph
			Parker revealed something important about his branch of the Parker family. Joseph made
			some peculiar stipulations regarding the inheritance of his son Thomas. The will
			described Thomas as "who by god's providence is disenabled for providing for himself or
			managing an estate if committed to him by reason of distemper of mind att certain
				seasons."28 The management of his portion of the estate
			was given to his mother Mary until her death, after which, Thomas would choose his own
			guardian.</p>
<p>This "distemper of mind" seemed to run in the family. Stephen Parker later petitioned in
			September 1685 that his mother be barred from the management of her own affairs for the
			same reason. Stephen revealed that his mother was in a "distracted condition and not
			capable of improving any of her estate for her owne comfort."29 Whether mental illness influenced the reputation of Joseph Parker's wife
			cannot be ascertained, but it is likely that if she was mentally instable, it was well
			known in the tight-knit community of Andover.</p>
<p>Mental illness was often distrusted and feared. In fact, a case in 1692 involved a woman
			with a history of mental illness. Rebecca Fox Jacobs confessed to witchcraft in 1692 and
			her mother Rebecca Fox petitioned both the Court of Oyer and Terminer and Massachusetts
			Governor Phips for her release on the grounds of mental illness. According to her
			mother, it was well known that Rebecca Jacobs had long been a "Person Craz'd Distracted
			&amp; Broken in mind."30 Evidently mental illness could have
			made someone more vulnerable to witchcraft accusations. This does not guarantee the
			girls intended to accuse Mary Stevens Parker but it does make the case for Mary Ayer
			Parker's misidentification stronger.</p>
<p>A notorious figure in Salem Towne, also named Mary Parker muddled the case further. This
			Mary Parker appeared multiple times in the Essex courts and made a reputation for
			herself beginning in 1670's. In 1669, she was sentenced for fornication.31 In 1672, the court extended her indenture to Moses Gillman
			for bearing a child out of wedlock. A year later, she went back to court for child
			support from Teague Disco of Exiter.32 The court sentenced her
			ten stripes for fornication. She came to trial two more times for fornication in 1676
				33. A scandalous figure indeed, Mary from Salem further
			sullied the name "Mary Parker."</p>
<p>A disreputable name could have been enough to kill the wrong woman in 1692. In a society
			where the literate were the minority, the spoken word was the most damaging. Gossip,
			passed from household to household and from town to town through the ears and mouths of
			women, was the most prevalent source of information. The damaged reputation of one woman
			could be confused with another as tales of "Goode So-and-so" filtered though the
			community. The accused Sarah Bishop had a history of witchcraft suspicions, especially
			concerning the death of Christian Trask. Her death, ruled a suicide, remained a
			controversy and many believed that Sarah Bishop had bewitched her.34 The Court of Oyer and Terminer questioned Sarah on April 22, 1692, but
			the "Goode Bishop" business did not stop there. Susanna Sheldon, joining the cast of
			afflicted girls, claimed that she saw Bridget Bishop in an apparition who told her she
			killed three women, one of them being Christian Trask.35 Sarah
			and Bridget lived in different parts of Salem but Susanna wrongly attributed gossip
			about Sarah Bishop to Bridget Bishop simply because they shared a last name. The
			confusion associated with their cases proved how easily gossip could be attributed to
			the wrong woman. The bad reputations garnered by Mary Parker the fornicator from Salem,
			and the mentally ill Mary Stevens Parker of Andover could have affected the
			vulnerability of Mary Ayer Parker.</p>
<p>Mary Ayer Parker told the truth about the other Marys, but the court ignored her. William
			Barker Jr. came in to speak against her. He testified "looking upon Mary Parker said to
			her face that she was one of his company, And that the last night she afflicted Martha
			Sprague in company with him."36 Barker Jr. pointed Mary out in
			court but he may have been confused himself. In his own confession, William accused a
			"goode Parker," but of course, he did not specify which Goody Parker he meant.37 There was a good possibility that William Barker Jr. heard
			gossip about one Goody Parker or another and the magistrates of the court took it upon
			themselves to issue a warrant for the arrest of Mary Ayer Parker without making sure
			they had the right woman in custody.</p>
<p>Mary Parker's luck plummeted when Mary Warren suffered a violent fit in which a pin ran
			through her hand and blood came from her mouth during her examination. Indictments
			followed for the torture and other evil acts against Sarah Phelps, Hanna Bigsbee, and
			Martha Sprague. Martha's indictment was rejected, returned reading "ignoramus,"38 but the indictments for both Hannah Bigsbee and Sarah Phelps
			were returned "billa vera", and the court held Mary Parker for trial. Sara claimed that
			Mary tortured her on the last day of August as well as "diverse other days and times."
			Hannah said that Mary tortured her on the first day of September: the indictment stated
			that she had been "Tortured aflicted Consumed Pined Wasted and Tormented and also for
			Sundry othe[r] Acts of Witchcraft."39</p>
<p>Capt. Thomas Chandler approved both indictments. Significantly both Sarah and Hanna were
			members of the Chandler family, one of the founding families in Andover. The Captain's
			daughter Sarah Chandler married Samuel Phelps on May 29, 1682. Their daughter Sara Jr.
			testified against Mary Parker in 1692.40 Hannah Chandler, also
			the daughter of Capt. Thomas, married Daniel Bigsbee on December 2, 1974.41 Capt. Thomas Chandler's daughter Hannah and granddaughter
			Sarah.gave evidence that held Mary for trial. Did the Chandler family have it out for
			the Parkers?</p>
<p>Thomas and his son William settled in Andover in the 1640s.42
			Elinor Abbot wrote that they originally came from Hertford, England.43 The revelation of strong Chandler ties to Mary's case is peculiar because
			until then, the relationship between the Parkers and the Chandlers seemed friendly.
			Public and private ties between William, Thomas, and the Parker brothers were manifest
			in the public records. Nathan and William Chandler held the responsibility of laying out
			the land lots, and probably shared other public duties as well.44 Joseph Parker's will called Ensigne Thomas Chandler45 his "loving friend", and made him overseer of his estate.46 Nathan Parker's land bordered Thomas Chandler's and there was
			no evidence of neighborly disputes.47 It is difficult to
			understand where the relationship went bad.</p>
<p>The only hint of any fallout between the families came more than a decade before Joseph
			Parker's 1678 will. On June 6, 1662, Nathan Parker testified in an apprenticeship
			dispute between the Tylers and the Chandlers.48 The Chandler
			family may have felt Nathan Parker unfairly favored the Tyler family in the incident.
			Bad blood between the Chandler and Tyler families could have translated into problems
			between the Chandler and Parker families. This discord would have been worsened by the
			alliance between the Tyler and Parker families through Hannah Parker and John Tyler's
			marriage in 1682.</p>
<p>This still does not seem enough to explain the Chandlers' involvement 1692. Perhaps after
			Nathan Parker's death in 1685, neighborly tensions arose between Mary's inherited state
			and the bordering Chandler estate. The existing records betray nothing further. Perhaps
			these speculated neighborly problems were coupled with the desire to distract attention
			from an internal scandal in the Chandler family.</p>
<p>In 1690 Hannah and Daniel Bigsbee testified in the trial of Elizabeth Sessions, a single
			woman in Andover who claimed to be pregnant with the child of Hannah's brother Joseph.
			The Bigsbees refuted her claim and insisted she carried the child of another man.49 The Chandlers were respected people in Andover; even
			Elizabeth referred to them as "great men," and they surely resented the gossip. The
			crisis of 1692 was a perfect opportunity for them to divert attention away from the
			scandal. When Mary Parker was arrested, they found the ideal candidate to take advantage
			of: her husband and her brother-in-law were no longer around to defend her and her young
			sons could not counter the power of the Chandlers.</p>
<p>After the initial indictments, Hannah Bigsbee and Sarah Phelps dropped from documented
			involvement in the case. Here, the documentation gets rather sloppy and confused. Essex
			Institute archivists erroneously mixed much of the testimony from Alice Parker's case in
			with Mary Parker's. When the irrelevant material is extracted, there is very little left
			of the actual case.50</p>
<p>The only other testimony came from two teenage confessors: Mercy Wardwell and William
			Barker Jr. On September 16, fourteen-year-old Barker told the Grand Inquest that Mary
			"did in Company with him s'd Barker : afflict Martha Sprag by: witchcraft. the night
			before: s'd Barker Confessed: which was: the 1 of Sept'r 1692".51 Eighteen-year-old Mercy did not name Mary a witch, but did say that "she
			had seen: the shape of Mary Parker: When she: s'd Wardwell: afflicted: Timo Swan: also:
			she: s'd she saw: s'd parkers Shape: when the s'd wardwell afflicted Martha
				Sprage".52</p>
<p>Nothing else remains of Mary Parker case. It appeared that Mary's trial was over on
			September 16, 1692. She was executed only six days later. Evidence seems lacking. In
			essence, Mary was convicted almost solely from the testimony from two teenage
			confessors. Her examination, indictment, and grand inquest all took place expediently,
			and within one month, Mary was accused, convicted and executed.</p>
<p>Her death seems irresponsible at the least, and even almost outrageous. She was convicted
			with such little evidence, and even that seems tainted and misconstrued. The Salem
			trials did her no justice, and her treatment was indicative of the chaos and
			ineffectualness that had over taken the Salem trials by the fall of 1692. However, her
			treatment by historians is even less excusable. The records of her case are disorganized
			and erroneous, but what has been written about the case is even more misinformed. Today
			it is impossible to exonerate the reputation of Mary Ayer Parker. The records that
			survive are too incomplete and confused. But perhaps we can acknowledge the possibility
			that amidst the fracas of 1692, a truly innocent woman died as the result of sharing the
			unfortunate name "Mary Parker."</p>

<h3>
			John Proctor
		</h3>
<p>Written by Justin Lugar, 2002</p>
<p>Of all the literature focused on the Salem witch trials of 1692, Arthur Miller's The
			Crucible is the only one to treat John Proctor as the main character. Proctor was a
			major figure to be put on trial and executed in the summer of 1692. And although his
			character in The Crucible is one of main significance, he is not portrayed in an
			historically accurate manner. Though certain features of Proctor prevail and are
			consistent with the record, he is contrived to be approximately 30 years younger in the
			play than his actual age of approximately 60-years-old in 1692. To get the true story of
			John Proctor, one must look to other sources including Paul Boyer and Stephen
			Nissenbaum's Salem Possessed, Bernard Rosenthal's Salem Story, and Charles Upham's Salem
			Witchcraft.</p>
<p>John Proctor was born in Ipswich, Massachusetts in 1632 to an established family of
			farmers. His father had left him a large estate , and in 1666, according to Boyer and
			Nissenbaum, Proctor moved near Salem Village. There, "he leased one of the largest farms
			of the area, 'Groton,' a 700-acre spread lying immediately southeast of the Village
			line." Although farming was his primary business, Proctor's wife Elizabeth and his
			daughter ran a local tavern. Thus, along with establishing himself as a prosperous and
			wealthy farmer, Proctor also diversified his economic interests by owning and operating
			a tavern on Ipswich Road. His economic standing was undoubtedly recognized within the
			community even though he held no official title. By the time of the witch trials of
			1692, Proctor was a well-established man of 60 years of age.</p>
<p>One of Arthur Miller's innovations in The Crucible is his description of Proctor as " a
			farmer in his middle thirties." Though age and historical fact are blurred in Miller's
			story, one prominent theme is apparent concerning the character of John Proctor. Proctor
			is described on several occasions, from various sources as a strong-willed beast of a
			man. Charles Upham writes, "He was a man of Herculean frame...he had great native force
			and energy...he was bold in his spirit and in his language." This strong character is
			also mentioned in Bernard Rosenthal's Salem Story,"Proctor had argued against the
			reliability of testimony from confessors...No one else had come as close as Proctor did
			to forcing the issue." Throughout the trials, Proctor stood up and questioned the
			credibility of spectral evidence. Testimony against John Proctor revealed his true
			feelings of the trials. Proctor did not conceal his vehement opposition to the trials
			and is recorded remarking about his servant Mary Warren, "he [Proctor] would fetch his
			jade Home &amp; thresh the Devil out of her." Another reference to such opposition is
			found in the testimony of Joseph Pope: "this deponent heard John Proctor Say that if mr
			Parish would let him have his Indian hee the s'd Procter would soone Drive the Divell
			out of him." With such strong feelings in opposition of the court, Proctor became a
			prime target of accusations. Thus it can be stated that John Proctor directly and on
			several occasions threatened the validity of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Regardless
			of the possible implications of such actions, his fellow inhabitants of Ipswich
			supported him after his arrest.</p>
<p>When facing trial in 1692, "thirty-two Ipswich men, headed by the minister, John Wise,
			signed a petition 'on behalf of our neighbors John Proctor and his wife, now in trouble
			and under suspicion of witchcraft'" (B&amp;N 202). The petition validates the character
			of John Proctor and his family. After receiving his sentence to die on Gallows Hill on
			August 19.1692, Proctor sought time to prepare for his death and secure the welfare of
			his estate for future generations. </p>
<p>One of 19 victims hanged in 1692, John Proctor embodies the legacy of innocence connected
			to the trials and executions of 1692. Proctor maintained his innocence until his death,
			all the while questioning the methods of the court and its acceptance of spectral
			evidence. Because of his constant protest of the court proceedings, Arthur Miller found
			John Proctor to embody many qualities important to The Crucible. Such a strong will to
			oppose the trials proved catastrophic for Proctor and in August of 1692, he paid the
			ultimate price.</p>

<h3>Ann Pudeator</h3>
<p>Executed on Sept. 22, 1692, the widow Ann Greenslit Pudeator 
    was one of the seven unfortunate victims of the final hanging on Gallows Hill 
    during the Salem witch trials. Highlights from her trial included the usual 
    testimony of the circle of accusing girls that Ann had afflicted them in "spectral" 
    form. John Best, Sr. also accused Ann of having murdered his wife, whom Ann 
    had served as a nurse. Mary Warren went to the extreme of implicating Pudeator 
    in the deaths of four people. Historian Carol Karlsen speculates that Pudeator 
    may have been targeted due to her profession as a midwife that placed her 
    in direct competition with male care providers, as well as her defiance of 
    the Puritan female gender ideal of meekness and submission to male authority. 
    Although the details of Ann Pudeator's birth are unknown, it is estimated 
    that she was between 70 and 75 when she was hanged, still protesting her innocence 
    at the hands of false accusations. </p>

<h3>
			Ann Pudeator
		</h3>
<p>Written By Rachel Walker </p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>When Ann was arrested on May 12th 1692, she was a twice-widowed woman of property in
			Salem Town. Although her testimony is well-documented in the transcripts of the Court of
			Oyer and Terminer, details of her origins before the trials of 1692 are largely unknown.
			Ann is thought to have been born in England sometime between 1622 and 1627. She married
			her first husband, Thomas Greenslit (also spelled Greenslade) and had five children with
			him sometime before 1677. Her name appears for the first time in the public record of
			Salem Town on the certificate of inventory for the his estate following his death in
			1674.</p>
<p>The family had likely lived in Falmouth, Maine during the birth of Ann's children,
			Thomas, Ruth, John, James, and Samuel, between 1650 &amp; 1660. Although the eventual
			whereabouts of each of her children remains almost as unknown as Ann's own activities,
			her eldest son Thomas Pudeator went on to play a central role in the trial of the
			Reverend George Burroughs. He testified to the man's extraordinary feat of strength in
			lifting a gun at arm's length with just one finger in the barrel. In Salem Story,
			historian Bernard Rosenthal suggests that this may have been a last-ditch effort by
			Thomas to save his own mother from execution by appearing to join sides with the
			witch-hunters.</p>
<p>Ann was left destitute after her first husband died in 1674, probably working in the paid
			profession of a midwife and nurse. Her name does not appear again until March of 1678,
			when she is recorded as the wife of her neighbor Jacob Pudeator, a man about 20 years
			her junior. This unusual circumstance was calls attention to the fact that Ann had
			served as nurse to Jacob's first wife Isabel during her illness, and married Jacob less
			than a year after Isabel's unexplained death between 1675-1676. Jacob, too, passed away
			in 1682, leaving monetary bequests to each of Ann's five children, as well as the
			remainder of his property to Ann herself. Afterwards, Ann occupied the rather precarious
			position of being a professional woman of property in a male-dominated society.</p>
<p>Historian Carol F. Karlsen suggests that Ann became a prime target for allegations of
			witchcraft after she scolded John Best, Jr. for returning her lost cow from his fold.
			Best claimed that "he did conclude said Pudeator was a witch" because she "would chide
			me when I came home from turning the cow back." In her book, The Devil in the Shape of a
			Woman, Karlsen argues that women such as Ann who dared to defy the Puritan gender
			standard of the unassertive and docile female put themselves at great risk to be singled
			out for punishment through witchcraft accusations. She also implies that Ann's
			occupation of midwife, regardless of whether she earned money (for this is not
			confirmed), may have threatened other male medical professionals in Salem Town, leading
			to accusations. Birth was a risky act and filled with apprehension in that time period,
			loss of life during the process was often blamed on the malignant forces of the devil at
			work through witchcraft.</p>
<p>Whatever the motivations for her accusers, a warrant for Ann Pudeator and another woman,
			Alice Parker, was written on May 12th 1692. Pudeator was brought to trial on July 2nd,
			1692. Sarah Churchill was the first to accuse Ann of having tormented her, by appearing
			with the book of the devil and asking her to sign it. She also accused Ann of having
			presented her with several images of accusing girls that she proceeded to torture like
			voodoo dolls with thorns. Five more of the circle of accusing girls confirmed these
			accusations - both Mary Warren and Ann Putnam falling into fits during Pudeator's
			examination and then being cured by a touch of Ann's hand. In addition to these
			displays, Elizabeth Hubbard, Mary Walcott, and Sarah Bibber also presented testimony
			that Pudeator had afflicted them through pinching, pressing and choking. The constable
			Joseph Neal described his discovery of "curious containers of various ointments"
			suspected to have been associated with Ann's alleged witchcraft at her house upon her
			arrest, and asserted that she was an "ill-carriaged woman" whom he was convinced had
			adversely affected his wife in her service as midwife. During her examination Ann
			insisted that these jars were simply filled with Neat's Foot Oil. Incriminating evidence
			of Ann's relation to animal familiars was given by Samuel Pickworth, who related seeing
			a bird fly by one night as he walked upon Salem Street, and soon after noticing a woman
			coming out of Ann's home, presumably the same entity as the bird. Going even farther,
			Mary Warren said that Pudeator had caused John Turner to fall from a tree, and accused
			Ann of killing her husband Jacob, Jacob's first wife Isabel, as well as the wives of
			John Best and Joseph Neal.</p>
<p>Throughout the trials, Ann remained consistent but relatively unassertive in her
			declrations of innocence. She insisted that she did not know her accusers, nor anything
			of the art of witchcraft. In response to curiosity about the ointments, she simply
			explained they were containers of grease to make her soap. Although her testimony in
			itself was not particularly noteworthy, her petition to the court, written before her
			death, merits acknowledgement for its simple denunciation of her accusers. Bernard
			Rosenthal brings this to light in his book, Salem Story,, pointing out that Ann accused
			Mary Warren, Sarah Churchill, John Best, Sr. and Jr., and Samuel Pickworth of bearing
			false witness against her. Particularly of note was her scathing addition that John Best
			Jr. was a known liar: "the abovesaid Jno Best hath been formerly whipt and likewise is
			[recorded] for a Lyar". In retrospect, this charge cast considerable doubt upon the
			validity of John's accusations, as well as the credibility of any court that would admit
			the testimony of a publicly acknowledged liar.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, not one of Ann's children came to her defense during the trials.
			Widowed and abandoned by her remaining kinfolk, Ann Pudeator, at that time somewhere
			between 70 and 75 years old, was hanged upon Gallows Hill on Sept. 22nd 1692, in what
			would be the final set of executions resulting from the Salem Witch trials.</p>

<h3>Spectors, Maleficium, and Margaret Scott
		</h3>
<p>Written by Mark Rice (Copyright, 2005)</p>
<p>History 209, An Undergraduate Court, Cornell University</p>
<p> Spring Semester, 2003</p>
<p>Revised for presentation to the Berkshire Conference, 2005</p>
<p> Margaret Scott possessed the characteristics that made her a prime suspect for any witch
			accusation during early New England. However, Scott was unlucky enough to be accused
			during the Salem witch hunts. As a result, Scott, an orthodox suspect, was thrown into a
			very unorthodox witch hunt with very little chance of survival. The evidence of Margaret
			Scott's case highlights the nature of witchcraft accusations in New England and the
			Salem witch-hunt. In the end, Margaret Scott was accused and executed on charges of
			witchcraft due to prolonged suspicion of her character, the spectral evidence provided
			in her trial, the maleficium evidence against her, and the prominence of the accusers in
			her community.</p>
<p>Margaret Scott was the only person to be accused of being a witch from Rowley during the
			Salem trials. This was mainly due to the fact that community members long thought of her
			as a witch. She most likely was suspected of witchcraft because of her low stature in
			the community, the number of child fatalities,long widowhood, and begging; all common
			traits among people accused of witchcraft.1</p>
<p>Margaret Scott's origins are obscure. Born Margaret Stevenson in England somewhere around
			the year 1615, she first appeared in the record books in 1642, when she married Benjamin
			Scott. Initially the Scotts lived in Braintree, but later moved to Cambridge where they
			had four children between 1644 and 1650. The Scott family arrived in Rowley in 1651
			where Margaret gave birth to three additional children. Of all the children, only three
			lived to adulthood. Still, by the time of the witchcraft trials, the seventy-seven
			year-old Margaret Scott had as many as eleven grandchildren.2</p>
<p>It is hard to pinpoint the status of the Scott family among the residents of Rowley.
			Evidence from Essex County records indicates that the Scots were not wealthy and never
			appeared in any positions suggesting importance or prominence. Benjamin Scott himself
			was never assigned a high-status title such as Mister or even the lower status title
			Goodman. The Scotts lacked the money to purchase their own land. Instead in 1664 the
			town donated land to Benjamin Scott.3 In March of 1665,
			Benjamin Scott was convicted of the crime of theft, for which he was "fined and
			admonished." However, six months later he took the Freeman's Oath, indicating he was
			both a householder and a church member, in short, an upstanding person.4 Benjamin Scott died in 1671 leaving an estate worth only 67 pounds and 17
			shillings, not much by the standards of that time. However, Margaret had to live on this
			estate for the next twenty-one years and by the time of the Salem trials, must have been
			very poor.5</p>
<p>At first glance, Margaret Scott seems to have lived an uneventful life. However, certain
			aspects of her character made her a very likely candidate as a witch suspect. One such
			aspect was the high infant mortality rate among her children. Women in New England who
			had trouble raising children were very vulnerable to witchcraft charges. In fact, only 7
			out of the 62 accused female witches in New England prior to 1692 had a considerable
			number of children.6</p>
<p>Out of Margaret's seven children, only three made it to adulthood. This does not consider
			any miscarriages or other problems that Scott may have had. Furthermore, only one of her
			three children born in Rowley lived to adulthood. The residents of Rowley would have
			been well aware of her high infant mortality rate.7</p>
<p>Another factor about Margaret Scott's character that made her vulnerable to accusations
			was her status as a widow for twenty-one years. Being a widow did not in itself expose a
			woman to suspicion.8 However, Scott suffered from the economic
			and social effects of being a widow for a prolonged period. The most dangerous aspect of
			being a widow was the lack of a husband for legal support and influence. Also, Scott, 56
			at the time of her husband's death, was forced to live off her husband's small estate
			for twenty-one years. Often widows who were over fifty and not wealthy, were unable to
			find a new spouse and thus were reduced to poverty and begging. By begging, Margaret
			would expose herself to witchcraft suspicions according to what historian Robin Briggs
			calls the "refusal guilt syndrome". This phenomenon occurred when a beggar's needs were
			refused causing feelings of guilt and aggression on the refuser's part. The refuser
			projected this aggression on the begger and grew suspicious of her.9</p>
<p>Some of the depositions against Scott did involve misfortunes occurring to people who had
			denied her a service or good. Perhaps Scott actually used her reputation to receive
			favors, which could be very effective. If people believed that Scott was a witch, they
			might have eagerly given her what she asked out of fear of retaliation. However, if
			someone refused Scott and then fell on bad circumstances, witchcraft suspicions and
			accusations were almost a certainty.10</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that Scott's widowhood suffering and dependence on begging resulted in
			part from a lack of familial support. Only Margaret Scott's son Benjamin stayed in
			Rowley. When Margaret Scott was accused of witchcraft, Benjamin, who had six children of
			his own at the time, offered no legal support. He probably lacked the time and money to
			pursue a legal defense of his mother.11
		</p>
<p>A careful examination of the depositions and witnesses shows a clear pattern among
			Margaret Scott's accusers. Many who were wealthy residents of the town who cooperated in
			the effort to convict Margaret of witchcraft. </p>
<p>Captain Daniel Wicom appeared as the central figure among the accusers. As a prominent
			member of Rowley, any witchcraft affliction that involved Wicom, who filled many town
			leadership positions, would have led to legal action against Scott.12 According to depositions presented against Scott, the residents of Rowley
			suspected her of being a witch for as many as twenty years but no action was taken until
			his daughter became afflicted by her. </p>
<p>The Wicoms were not the only prominent family of Rowley involved with the accusations
			against Margaret Scott. The Nelson family also played an active role in the trial.
			Thomas and Phillip Nelson were brothers; Sarah was Philip's wife. Their father, Captain
			Philip Nelson, passed away in 1691 leaving an estate of 500 pounds suggesting that both
			Thomas and Philip were well off themselves. Unfortunately, records fail to distinguish
			between Philip the father and Philip the son. However, the prominence of the name of
			Philip Nelson in town records suggests that the family was wealthy and powerful.13</p>
<p>What is notable among the many appearances of Nelsons and Wicoms in the Essex County
			records is actually what did not occur. While the two families appear in many land
			disputes, they never appear as opponents. While one cannot assume that both families
			were friends, it is safe to say that they were not enemies. Philip Nelson gave testimony
			that supported Daniel Wicom in a 1679 trial and in 1680 the two men sided together in
			another court case. 14 The connection between the Wicoms and
			the Nelsons as Margaret Scott's chief accusers continued with the deposition of Philip
			and Sarah Nelson who testified to the affliction of deceased Robert Shillito, who lived
			in Daniel Wicom's tithing district. Wicom would have collected Shillito's taxes, been in
			contact with him, and have been very familiar with his supposed affliction. The final
			connection occurred in the deposition of Thomas Nelson. At the end of his testimony, the
			record indicated him as a member of the grand jury giving him the power to determine
			Margaret Scott's fate extending the Nelson-Wicom connection to nearly all aspects of the
			trial. 15</p>
<p>The depositions offered against Margaret Scott highlight the rumors about her reputation
			and the common beliefs that circulated about witches in early New England. Of the six
			depositions presented before the Salem Court on September 15th, four described the
			spectral image of Margaret Scott tormenting others. Some depositions given showed that
			many people suspected Scott was a witch long before 1692. The spectral evidence came
			from the depositions of young women who may have been influenced by their paranoia
			surrounding Indian hostilities, social pressures, and religious beliefs. </p>
<p>According to the evidence, Margaret Scott's specter first attacked Frances Wicom at the
			beginning of the trials at Salem around the tenth of June and continued to do so until
			the date of her examination on August 5th. The seventeen year old Frances gave her
			deposition to the court at Salem on September 15, 1692. Describing afflictions that were
			believed to be very common Frances stated that Margaret Scott "came to me and most
			grievously torment me by choacking and almost presing me to death".16</p>
<p>Several factors may have led Frances Wicom to testify to such a terrible experience
			including her home environment and its relationship with Indian conflicts. She
			undoubtedly would have heard first hand accounts of bloody conflicts with Indians. New
			evidence shows that a direct correlation can be found between anxiety over Indian Wars
			being fought in Maine and witchcraft accusations. In such a tense environment where New
			England was tormented by Satan through witches and Indians, who were thought to be
			servants of the devil, young girls would have been willing to accuse any one who was
			remotely suspicious making Scott, who already had a shady reputation, an easy
				target.17</p>
<p>Frances's family's high status in Rowley may have made also have made her a likely
			candidate for being "afflicted". The Wicoms's affluence would have made Frances the
			object of attention in Rowley society. Being afflicted gave Frances an outlet so she
			could say and do anything without any consequences providing a great release for a girl
			who lived in such a proper setting as the Wicom household and Puritan society in
				general.18</p>
<p>The second sufferer from spectral torture, Mary Daniel, also presented her deposition at
			the trial in Salem on September 15. It too listed many painful torments at the hands of
			Margaret Scott.19</p>
<p>No records of Mary Daniel's birth or parents exist. The first time Mary Daniel entered
			the record books was for her baptism on December 6, 1691. She next appeared for her
			accusations of Margaret Scott. There was a good chance that Mary Daniel was actually a
			servant in the household of Reverend Edward Payson, minister of Rowley at the time of
			the trials. 20 He obviously would have encouraged her to
			become a member of the Puritan faith.21</p>
<p>If Mary Daniel worked for Mr. Payson, her religious surroundings could well have had an
			effect on her actions. Recent converts to Puritanism felt inadequate and unworthy and at
			times displaced their worries through possession. Although Mary Daniel was never
			possessed, her baptism only a few months before the Salem witch hunt presumably
			increased the pressures of her religion. These feelings would only have been heightened
			if she in fact served in the household of the local minister.22</p>
<p>The third piece of spectral evidence against Margaret Scott came from another young
			woman, Sarah Coleman, who deposed that Scott's specter had tortured her on August
			fifteenth "by pricking, pinching, and choaking of me." Although born in Rowley, the
			twenty-two-year-old Coleman lived in neighboring Newbury with her parents for the
			previous nineteen years. The senior Colemans probably knew of Margaret Scott's
			reputation for witchcraft before they moved to Newbury; that knowledge, combined with
			the region-wide gossip about Scott's more recent malefic activities, undoubtedly in 1692
			led their daughter to accuse their former townswoman.23</p>
<p>Two Rowley residents, Phillip and Sarah Nelson, testified about conversations with Robert
			Shilleto. The Nelsons deposed that Shilleto believed himself a victim of Margaret
			Scott's afflictions and "we have often heard him complaining of Margaret Scott for
			hurting of him, and often said that she was a witch." The Nelsons also described how his
			affliction lasted for two or three years before Shilleto passed away in 1687 showing
			that Scott was suspected of being a witch long before the Salem Witch Hunt
				occurred.24</p>
<p>Spectral evidence was not the only tool that accusers used in Margaret Scott's trial. Two
			depositions presented at her September 15th appearance before the court examined how
			Scott tormented people through maleficium, a witches's harming of one's property,
			health, or family. Of the depositions offered both presented examples of the refusal
			guilt syndrome among the accusers. The depositions also showed how an ability to predict
			the future, and damage to livestock raised suspicions against an individual. 25</p>
<p>The deposition presented to the Salem court on September 15th by Daniel Wicom provided
			evidence of maleficium. His testimony described an encounter with Margaret Scott that
			occurred about five or six years before the trial when he did not give Scott corn. He
			reported that Scott predicted that he would be unable to harvest corn that evening and
			immediately oxen started to act in a strange way making it unable for Wicom to harvest
			his fields. 26</p>
<p>Wicom's deposition provided an example of refusal guilt syndrome where he initially
			denied a good to Margaret Scott only to suffer an inconvenience directly related to what
			Scott was begging for. This testimony also provided evidence that described Scott's
			ability to predict the future, which was a trait thought to be used by witches.27</p>
<p>More evidence centering on maleficium came from Thomas Nelson, whose statement was also
			influenced by refusal guilt syndrome. Nelson testified that when Margaret Scott was
			"Earnest she was for me to bring her wood" and he refused to deliver it immediately one
			of his cows acted in a strange way and another died.28
			Nelson's deposition not only describes many classic characteristics of maleficium, but
			also includes information about his loss of cattle which was a symbol of status, common
			in many witchcraft accusations in New England. In attacking his livestock Thomas Nelson
			believed that Margaret Scott was a threat to his position among the other men in the
				town.29 In his deposition, Nelson testifies that after the
			death of his cows he "had hard thoughts of this woman."30</p>
<p>Major events in Margaret Scott's case coincided with important dates of the Salem
			witchcraft court. When compared to the testimony against Scott, clear patterns can be
			found between the evidence brought against her and the timing of the Salem court.31</p>
<p>Evidence from the girls' testimony was synonymous with important events in the Salem
			trials. Frances Wicom was the first girl to experience spectral torment in 1692 "quickly
			after the first Court at Salem." Frances also testified that Scott's afflictions on her
			stopped on the day of her examination, August 5. Mary Daniel deposed on August 4 that
			Margaret Scott afflicted her on "ye 2d day of the week last past," which would have
			coincided with Scott's arrest. The third afflicted girl, Sarah Coleman, testified that
			the specter of Margaret Scott started to afflict her on the 15th of August, which fell
			ten days after the trials of George Burroughs and Scott's own examination. Additionally,
			the 15th was only four days before the executions of Burroughs, John Proctor, John
			Willard, George Jacobs, and Martha Carrier; accused who were not "usual suspects" that
			brought considerable attention to the Salem proceedings.32</p>
<p>Once Margaret Scott's case came before the Salem court, the magistrates were eager to
			prosecute her for witchcraft. At the same time that Margaret Scott appeared in front of
			the court, critics of the proceedings had become more vocal expressing concern over the
			wide use of spectral evidence in the Salem trials. The court probably took the
			opportunity to prosecute Margaret Scott to help its own reputation. Margaret Scott's
			case not only involved spectral evidence, but also a fair amount of maleficium evidence.
			Scott exhibited many characteristics that were believed common among witches in New
			England. Additionally, the spectral testimony given by the afflicted girls bolstered the
			accusers' case. With a combination of solid maleficium and spectral evidence against
			her, the proceedings took only one day to complete. To the judges at Salem, Margaret
			Scott was perfect candidate to highlight the court's effectiveness. By executing Scott,
			the magistrates at Salem could silence critics of the trials by executing a "real witch"
			suspected of being associated with the devil for many years.33
		</p>
<p>Margaret Scott was executed at Salem as a result of a suspicious reputation, the
			combination of spectral and maleficium evidence against her, the close relationship
			among her accusers, and the timing of her trial. Margaret Scott's downfall resulted from
			a series of misfortunes that she could not avoid. Impoverished and isolated from her
			long widowhood, Scott's shady reputation made her an easy target for witchcraft
			suspicions. Her accusers' depositions describe many typical beliefs about witches in
			early New England built up over a prolonged period of time. Even the actions taken
			against her by the prominent families of Rowley were not uncommon in New England
			witchcraft. Margaret Scott simply could not avoid the key factor in her condemnation;
			her profile as a "usual suspect". Unlike many of the other accused before the court,
			Scott was faced with an equal amount of spectral and maleficium evidence. The proponents
			of the court saw the opportunity to use Margaret Scott to their advantage. Her case
			showed the court relieving a community of a long believed witch and distracted attention
			from other defendants who were convicted on much more questionable evidence.</p>

<h3>Samuel Wardwell</h3>
<p>Samuel Wardwell was born on May 16, 1643 to a modest Quaker family in Boston. 
He studied carpentry and moved to Andover, Massachusetts in 1672 to find work. 
There he married his second wife, Sarah Hawkes, a wealthy widow with whom he had 
seven children. In 1692, he was accused of witchcraft and brought to trial in 
Salem. The fact he was found guilty is not surprising, as he had dabbled in fortune 
telling as a young man, had family members who were disliked in Andover, and had 
married a woman whom many did not think he was worthy of marrying. During his 
court examination, he confessed to being a witch by submitting a long and detailed 
story of his indiscretions in order to save his life. His conscience and personal 
courage led him to recant the story and claim innocence, knowing the risk involved. 
He was hanged on September 22, 1692.

<h3>
			Samuel Wardwell
		</h3>
<p>Written By Brendan Dignan</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Samuel Wardwell was born on May 16, 1643 to Thomas Wardwell and Elizabeth Hooper in
			Boston, Massachusetts. Samuel was the youngest of three boys. Martha, the only girl,
			died in 1337 during childbirth. Though little is known of the Wardwell family, they seem
			to have come from a modest Quaker background, and each boy was not afforded a great
			inheritance. Young Samuel took an interest in carpentry and was finishing a
			apprenticeship in Boston in 1664, at the age of twenty-one, when his life would take a
			different course toward the town of Salem.</p>
<p>In 1664, Samuel's eldest brother, Eliakim, had moved to New Jersey and became a leader
			among the large numbers of Quakers who had recently moved there. At the same time,
			Samuel's other brother, Benjamin, moved to Salem in search of a seaman's job in the
			town's thriving commercial shipping business (Robinson 57). Young Samuel decided to
			follow his brother to Salem in order to practice carpentry. At this time, Salem was
			rapidly growing, as old houses were being enlarged, and many new ones were being built
			.</p>
<p>Upon moving to Salem, Samuel met an unidentified woman whom he married and they had a son
			named Thomas. Unfortunately, his wife died in 1671 and Samuel moved to nearby Andover
			with his young son in search of a new life. There were several prominent men living in
			Andover at the time. One of these was Simon Bradstreet, a magistrate, who had gotten
			into a conflict with Eliakim Wardwell. Eliakim had called the magistrate's daughter, a
			"dishonest woman." There is a good chance that the bad blood between these two families
			would be a cause for Samuel's indictment for witchcraft twenty years later. Another
			established resident of Andover was Richard Barker. Barker's twenty-five year-old
			daughter, Sarah, fell in love with Samuel Wardwell, and the couple planned to marry.
			However, because Samuel was not a member of Andover's leading families, the couple's
			plans were quickly halted.</p>
<p>Since moving to Andover, Samuel often amused his neighbors by telling fortunes, a
			practice forbidden by the Puritan religion, because it was regarded as a magical
			activity. It is likely that Samuel was simply immature and practiced magic for sport.
			However, several members of Andover knew of his pastime, and remembered them years later
			in 1692. "He was fabled, for example to have the strange power of getting into people's
			dreams, and regulating matters there to his own fancy (Robinson 62)." In addition, he
			prophesized in 1677 that a young couple in Andover would have five daughters before they
			had a son. Amazingly, this turned out to be true. Unfortunately for Wardwell, the boy
			was born just a few years before the witch scare, furthering his link to the
			supernatural and placing him as a suspect for witchcraft.</p>
<p>In the years prior to the witch trials, anyone dabbling in magic or fortune telling was
			thought to be linked to the devil. Though the practice of fortune telling was not
			uncommon among New Englanders in the seventeenth century, Wardwell's well-known practice
			of magic, albeit for sport, made him a prime target for witchcraft accusation in
			1692.</p>
<p>The final reason for Wardwell's accusation of witchcraft, was due to his neighbors'
			jealousy of his sudden wealth. As can be seen in cases of other accused persons in Salem
			and Andover, those who gained or lost wealth were more prone to be accused than others.
			To everyone surprise, Sarah Hawkes, a young, beautiful, twenty-two year-old widow, with
			a sizable inheritance, decided to marry Samuel Wardwell on January 9, 1673. Samuel was
			not a member of the gentry and had no dowry to offer Sarah. Nevertheless, they married
			and preceded to have seven children. Their three boys were Samuel, Jr., Eliakim, and
			William. Samuel and Sarah's four girls were Mercy, Elizabeth (who died in three days),
			another Elizabeth, and Rebecca. Due to Sarah's sizable inheritance and Samuel's hard
			work as a carpenter, the couple lived a prosperous life with a large farm in the south
			of Andover, and land in Lynn. (Robinson 62-63).</p>
<p>As the witchcraft scare rose in 1692, the Wardwells were living comfortably on their
			farm. At the age of 49, Samuel was arrested on August 15, 1692 and imprisoned in Salem
			Town. With him, wife Sarah and daughters Sarah and Mercy were also accused of
			witchcraft. Though Samuel was one of the last in the Salem area to be arrested, it was
			not surprising that the witchcraft court tracked him down. Not only had Wardwell dabbled
			in magic, but he had gained sizable wealth for a common citizen. In addition, his
			brother's affront to Andover's leading citizen, Simon Bradstreet, sealed his fate, as
			most of his accusers came from Andover.</p>
<p>On September 1, 1692, Samuel confessed before magistrate John Higginson, saying that he
			had indeed dabbled in the supernatural by "telling of fortunes, which sometimes came to
			pass." Not only did he confess this indiscretion, he also reported making a pact with
			the devil. Wardwell confessed that the devil promised to make him "live comfortably and
			be a sea captain." In return, Wardwell promised to "honor" him, signing the devil's
			"book by making a mark like a square with a black pen." Samuel Wardwell's claim seems

<p>Soon, however, Wardwell's conscience made him recant his confession. Now, not only was he

			found Wardwell guilty on September 17th. He was hanged on September 22, 1692, along with
			seven women.</p>

<p>John Willard was accused of witchcraft at the end of April 1692, after
refusing to arrest people that he believed were innocent.  One of his
main accusers was his wife's grandfather, Bray Wilkins, who claimed that
after a mean look from Willard, he became immediately sick.  While

<h3>
			John Willard
		</h3>
<p>Written by Joclyn Williams, 2002</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2002</p>
<p>Little is known about the early life of John Willard. He spent his youth in Lancaster,
			Massachusetts, then moved to Groton and married Margaret Wilkins in the 1680s. Margaret
			was a third-generation member of the large Wilkins family of Salem village. His
			connection with the Wilkins family played a large role the accusations against him. At
			the start of the trials, Willard was a deputy constable who was responsible for helping
			arrest those people accused of witchcraft. He began to doubt the validity of the trials
			and the guilt of those who had been accused. He is said to have spoken out against the
			proceedings with the words, "Hang them. they ar all witches." According to Robert Calef,
			an author contemporary to the trials, Willard had become dissatisfied with his job
			because he did not believe that everyone was guilty. Shortly after his reversal of
			opinion, Willard was accused. </p>
<p>The first accusations came in the end of April from Ann Putnam, Jr, who stated that
			Willard not only tormented her, but had also beaten her baby sister, Sarah, to death.
			Afraid of possible indictment, Willard approached his wife's grandfather, Bray Wilkins
			an influential church member for help, but Wilkins was unable to meet with Willard at
			that time. Several days later, Wilkins encountered Willard at a dinner in Boston.
			Wilkins reported that Willard "lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before
			discerned in any." Immediately after that Wilkins found himself in great pain due to his
			inability to urinate. After a few days of suffering, Wilkins consulted a woman skilled
			in medicine who told him that witchcraft was likely responsible for his distress.
			Wilkins was afraid that Willard had "done me wrong." His suspicions were further
			compounded when Wilkins returned home to find his grandson, Daniel, deathly sick. Daniel
			had earlier wished that Willard would be hanged because of his supposed connection to
			witchcraft.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Willard, Daniel died on May 16 after Mercy Lewis and others had claimed
			that they had seen him afflicting both Bray Wilkins and Daniel. Mercy testified that "I
			also saw the apperishtion of John willard there greviously afflecting the body of
			Daniell wilkens who laid speechless and in a sad condition and John willard tould me he
			would kill Daniell with in Two days if he could." The coroner's jury found evidence that
			Daniel had died an unnatural death. </p>
<p>The first arrest warrant for John Willard was issued on May 10 by John Hathorne and
			Jonathan Corwin, but Willard had fled Salem Village in anticipation of his arrest. This
			warrant does not name any particular person as the afflicted, but most likely refers to
			the accusations of Ann Putnam, Jr. On May 15 a second warrant was issued, this time it
			charged him with "sundry acts of Witchcraft by him donne or Committed on the Bodys of
			Bray Wilkins and Daniell Wilkins." </p>
<p>Willard was arrested in Groton on May 17 and underwent examination the following day.
			During this examination, Willard maintained his innocence: "I am as innocent as the
			child unborn." During the first part of the hearing, testimony of the afflicted girls
			and Wilkins family members were present. The next part was the physical test. This
			consisted largely of spectral evidence from the girls. Susannah Sheldon and Mary Warren
			both had terrible fits when they tried to approach Willard. For the final part of the
			exam, Willard was asked to recite the Lord's Prayer, but was unable to complete it.
			Despite all of this, Willard refused to confess at Hathorne's urging: "If it was the
			last time I was to speak, I am innocent."</p>
<p> Others who contributed to Willard's conviction include Ann Putnam, Sr. who claimed that
			she had seen many ghosts who claimed that Willard had killed them; Sarah Vibber who
			witnessed Lewis's affliction at the hands of Willard; and several members of the Wilkins
			family. Confessors, including Richard Carrier, Margaret Jacobs, and Sarah Churchwell,
			also accused Willard of witchcraft. </p>
<p>John Willard was hanged on August 19, 1692 along with John Proctor, George Burroughs,
			George Jacobs, Sr., and Martha Carrier. According to Thomas Brattle, Willard died a good
			death, maintaining his innocence until the end. Bernard Rosenthal believes that Willard
			was not memorialized in history like others who refused to confess because of his
			reputation for beating his wife. Willard was an honorable man in the fact that he was
			not willing to compromise his integrity to save his life, but his personal life does not
			appear to promote him as a hero. This detail is disputed by the fact that Willard quit
			his work as deputy constable when he doubted the guilt of the accused - a noble move
			that more than likely cost him his life.</p>

<h3>Sarah Osborne</h3>
<p>In February of 1692, Sarah Osborne became one of the first three 
    victims to be accused of witchcraft in Salem Village. As the widow of Robert 
    Prince-a Salem Villager who purchased a 150-acre farm next to his friend Captain 
    John Putnam's, Osborne was required (by Prince's will) to carry-over their 
    estate to their two young sons. However, by attempting to overtake possession

    of witchcraft by the Putnam family. She died in prison on May 10, 1692. </p>

<h3>
			Sarah Osborne
		</h3>
<p>Written By Meghan Carroll</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Born in Watertown, Massachusetts in about 1643, Sarah Warren married Robert Prince, a
			Salem Villager who purchased a 150-acre farm next to Captain John Putnam's. Putnam was
			Prince's neighbor and also his brother-in-law and the executor (along with Thomas
			Putnam) of his will. When Prince died prematurely in 1674, he left his land entrusted to
			his wife Sarah with the provision that upon their coming of age, it be given to his and
			Sarah's two sons -- James, who was six-years-old at the time, and Joseph, who was two.
			However, soon after her husband's death, Sarah hired an indentured Irish immigrant by
			the name of Alexander Osborne as a farm hand and paid off his indenture. Rumors spread
			about Sarah and Alexander's living together and eventually the two were married. Sarah,
			then attempted to overtake her children's inheritance and seize control of the estate
			for herself and her new husband, thus breaking her deceased husband's will. Legal
			battles ensued between Osborne and her children, who were the rightful heirs of Prince's
			land and were defended by the Putnams. Such conflict continued until February of 1692
			when Sarah Osborne became one of the first three persons accused of witchcraft in
			Salem.</p>
<p>Sarah was accused by Thomas and Edward Putnam, Joseph Hutchinson, and Thomas Preston for
			afflicting Ann Putnam, Jr., Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, and Elizabeth Hubbard.
			Unlike the other two women accused with her, Tituba and Sarah Good, Osborne never
			confessed to witchcraft nor attempted to accuse anyone else. In her own defense, she was
			the first defendant to assert in her defense the theological claim that the devil could
			take the shape of another person without their compliance -- a view that eventually
			prevailed and brought the Salem trials to a halt. Nonetheless, Osborne never came to
			trial because she died, shackled in prison on May 10, 1692 at the age of 49.</p>
<p>Why was Sarah Osborne accused of witchcraft? To answer this question, we must look
			closely at the society in which she lived and at her reputation in it. Historians Paul
			Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum argue that many of the accused witches were perceived as
			upsetting established "patterns of land tenure and inheritance." Sarah Osborne fits this
			profile. Not only was Salem Village aware of her fornication with Alexander (an obvious
			Puritan sin), but by endeavoring to gain full ownership of her late husband's estate,
			she disregarded her society's set practices of inheritance and land tenure, and
			challenged the tradition of strong, extended family alliances. By aspiring to deny her
			two sons of their wealth and social position, she threatened the growth and stability of
			Putnam family alliances in Salem Village.</p>
<p>Is a woman who betrays her society's social and family conventions worthy of an
			accusation of witchcraft? Not in today's society, but in seventeenth century New England
			these offenses were socially and economically serious, and a threat to the divinely
			sanctioned social order. Specifically, the Putnam family's economic interests and
			inheritance grew less secure by Sarah's attempt at social and economic independence.
			Consequently, but not surprisingly, it was members of the Putnam family who accused
			Osborne.</p>
<p>While such theories may offer explanations as to why Sarah Osborne, as opposed to her
			husband Alexander, was accused of witchcraft, we might also ask why she was actually
			convicted. If only 19 of the approximately 160 people accused were actually executed,
			what prevented Sarah Osborne from surviving? Unlike Tituba and Sarah Good who both
			confessed to witchcraft and falsely accused Osborne, Osborne did not confess nor did she
			accuse anyone else, and hence unknowingly at this stage, she closed an opportunity that
			might have saved her. Even though it later became apparent that the way to survive an
			accusation was to confess and to point fingers at others, Sarah Osborne repeatedly
			affirmed her innocence. When asked by local officials why she practiced with the devil,
			Osborne responded with bewilderment that she "was more like to be bewitched than that
			she was a witch." Ultimately, it was her refusal to compromise her integrity that cost
			Sarah Osborne her life.</p>

<h3>
			Governor, Sir William Phips
		</h3>
<p>Written by Kelly Mayer, 2003</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Fall Semester 2003</p>
<p>William Phips was born in a small English community in coastal Maine, now called
			Woolwich, on February 2, 1651. His father, James Phips, operated a trading post,
			engaging in the fur trade and repair of firearms with the Wabanaki Indians and local
			settlers. William spent most of his childhood carrying out chores on his family's farm,
			leaving little time for formal education. In fact, he did not learn to read or write
			until later in life, and never with great ease. </p>
<p>At 18, Phips took a four-year apprenticeship with a shipbuilder. In 1673, at the
			culmination of the four years, Phips moved to Boston to work as a shipwright. Shortly
			after, he married Mary Spencer Hull, the widow of merchant John Hull of Boston. Boston
			afforded Phips greater social status and he became a ship's captain. At this time, Phips
			was what Daniel Defoe defined in Essay upon Projects (1697) as projector--an "individual
			who sought wealth and advancement through money-making schemes financed by others." In
			the summer of 1683, Phips traveled to London to seek patronage for treasure hunting
			expeditions in the Caribbean, which he received from several high-ranking naval officers
			and the royal crown. In 1687, Phips discovered substantial treasure aboard the sunken
			Spanish ship, Concepción. Phips' crew recovered between 205,000 and 210,000 English
			pounds of treasure. Phips' share amounted to 11,000 pounds after the crews were paid and
			one tenth was given to the king. </p>
<p>Phips' great discovery made him a celebrity in England. In late June of 1687, Phips was
			knighted by King James II 'in consideration of his Loyalty, and good services in a late
			Expedition.' He returned to Boston as New England's provost marshal general, a legal
			position for which he had no experience. He did not remain in Boston long, and returned
			to England to give up his post. </p>
<p>While in Boston, Phips had befriended the president of Harvard College, Rev. Increase
			Mather and his son, the Rev. Cotton Mather. In 1689, Phips made a profession of faith at
			North Church, the church of Rev. Cotton Mather, and was baptized. It is unclear whether
			Phips really did discover a new sense of spirituality, or whether he desired to initiate
			a relationship with Mather and his father. Whatever his reason, Phips' relationship with
			the Mathers proved politically successful, as they ensured that he was chosen to command
			military expeditions against the French colonies of Acadia and Canada. These expeditions
			proved disastrous, and Phips spent the next two years in London with Increase Mather,
			petitioning for the Massachusetts Charter. When the charter was granted in 1691, Mather
			used his influence to nominate Phips as the first Royal Governor of the colony. </p>
<p> Phips returned to Massachusetts on May 14, over two months after the witchcraft
			accusations began in Salem Village. Phips established the Court of Oyer and Terminer, to
			"hear and determine" the large backlog of cases. Until recently, historians have failed
			to recognize the extent of Governor William Phips' involvement in the Salem witch
			trials, probably because Phips made a determined effort to distance himself from the
			ordeal. Phips wrote letters to England in which he acknowledged the existence of the
			trials but claimed to be fighting Indians during "almost the whole time of the
			proceeding." Mary Beth Norton proves that such claims were false and that Phips "had in
			fact been in Boston during most of the court sessions." </p>
<p>According to Norton, Phips was well informed about the trials and supported them while
			they lasted. Using surviving council minutes as her basis, Norton asserts: "Phips met
			regularly throughout June and July with the judges of the Court of Oyer and Terminer."
			Therefore, he "must have been well informed about the progress of the witchcraft
			trials." According to Norton, it is highly unlikely, "if not wholly impossible" that
			they did not discuss the trials during these meetings, since the subject was of such
			"pressing importance to everyone." Both the governor and his wife met many of the
			criteria that identified witches--i.e. engaging in treasure hunting, consulting a
			fortune teller, employing a servant of Indian origins, having extensive links to
			Maine--and Phips probably supported the trials to protect himself and his wife from
			possible accusations.</p>
<p> In October, Governor Phips permanently shut down the Court of Oyer and Terminer due to
			both political and personal reasons. Much debate had been "roiling the colony's
			political and religious elite" since Phips had partially halted the proceedings on
			October 12 to wait for orders from England. A "political and theological firestorm"
			erupted between supporters and opponents of the trials. Supporters wanted the
			proceedings to continue without delay. Opponents were upset that arrests and
			prosecutions would continue during the many months it would take to receive word from
			the monarch. Phips realized that the best way to quiet the discontent was to dissolve
			the court entirely. On a personal level, Norton points out that "in his letters to
			England, Phips stressed his growing realization that apparitions could appear in the
			form of innocents." Such a realization must have weighed heavily on Phips when he
			thought about the enormous importance given to spectral evidence in the trials. Shortly
			after the trials, in mid-November 1694, complaints by William's political opponents
			caused the king to recall him to England. He died of fever in London in February
			1695.</p>

<h3>John Hathorne</h3>
<p>Born into a well-established Salem family on August 5, 1641, 
    John Hathorne became a local Salem magistrate and was chosen by Governor Sir 
    William Phips to be a judge in the Salem Witch Trials. During the trials, 
    Hathorne took on the role of a prosecutor rather than an impartial judge. 
    Hathorne's questioning always began with a presumption of guilt rather than 
    innocence, and he appeared to be on the side of the accusers. Hathorne altered 
    the tradition of previous witch trials by encouraging those under examination 
    not only to confess to witchcraft but also to name others who might be witches 
    - a move that accelerated the number of accusations. He died in Salem on May 
    10, 1717, and was later a prominent target of criticism by his own great-grandson, 
    Nathaniel Hawthorne. </p>

<h3>
			John Hathorne
		</h3>
<p>By Devan Kirk</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>On August 5, 1641, John Hathorne was born into a community that could have little
			suspected his future role in the condemnation and death of so many people. His prominent
			ancestry in Salem led him to acquire positions of justice of the peace and county judge.
			As a religious man in a highly religious community, Hathorne, like others, believed that
			the devil had the power to influence people to do harm in the community and in the
			church. Hathorne allowed his strong, unexamined, beliefs to influence him during his
			time as judge in the Salem Witchcraft Trials, thus making him take on an avid
			prosecutorial style and an assumption of guilt of most of those who answered his
			questions.</p>
<p>Usually, Hathorne began his questioning in an accusatory tone, and he would then proceed
			to badger the accused in an attempt to drive out a confession and, better yet, more
			accusations. Although these methods were a departure from tradition, Hathorne used them
			throughout the trials. One classic example of Hathorne at work as a judge is the
			examination of Rebecca Nurse. He begins not by asking Nurse if she is guilty or
			innocent, but by asking the afflicted if Nurse afflicts them. He then asks Rebecca,
			"here are two An: Putman the child &amp; Abigail Williams complains of your hurting them
			What do you say to it" and Nurse replies that she is innocent." Hathorne, of course,
			does not let it rest at that. He continues, "Here is never a one in the Assembly but
			desires it, but if you be guilty Pray God discover you" and then allows the people in
			the room to stand and testify as to how Nurse afflicted each of them, relentlessly
			asking Rebecca after each how and if she denies them. He persists, asking, "You see
			these accuse you, is it true?" in response to which Nurse states "No," but, not being
			the answer that Hathorne desired he asks again, "Are you an innocent person relating to
			this Witchcraft." Hathorne then continued to allow the accusations of others to be heard
			until Rebecca Nurse cried, "Oh Lord help me, &amp; spread out her hands, &amp; the
			afflicted were grievously vexed" to which Hathorne replies in his usual accusatory
			manner, "Do you not see what a solemn condition these are in? when your hands are loose
			the persons are afflicted." Frustrated by her continued claim of innocence, Hathorne
			states, "It is very awful to all to see these agonies &amp; you an old Professor
			[believer] thus charged with contracting with the Devil by the [a] effects of it &amp;
			yet to see you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet" to which Rebecca Nurse
			courageously asserts "You do not know my heart." It is here that Hathorne slips in his
			composure and openly states, "You would do well if you are guilty to confess &amp; give
			Glory to God" - thus showing his already formed opinion as to her guilt and his
			preference for confessions. The questioning then continues and Hathorne switches into a
			new mode and attempts to trick Nurse into confessing, "Possibly you [Nurse] may
			apprehend you are no witch, but have you not been led aside by temptations that way"
			for, if Nurse confessed to either, she would be confessing at least to the practice of
			witchcraft still, and could still be punished. Again the badgering by Hathorne continued
			until finally Nurse asked a revealing question to which she received no answer, "Would
			you [Hathorne] have me belie my self." This questioned posed to Hathorne shows that
			Nurse suspected that Hathorne desired her to confess even though she was innocent, and
			her brave questioning of him ended the examination.</p>
<p>Hathorne's role in the trials leaves room for questioning his motives for participating.
			Prior to Governor Phip's arrival in Massachusetts, both Hathorne and Corwin had actively
			jailed many who were suspected of witchcraft, thus setting the scene for each man to be
			biased toward the guilt of those accused. Hathorne also appeared strangely calm while
			questioning those accused of acting in the devil's name. Even Bridget Bishop wondered
			why he did not fear that she would harm him if she was a witch: Hathorne: How can you
			[Bridget Bishop] know, you are no Witch, &amp; yet not know what a Witch is. Bridget
			Bishop: I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it. (SWP I: 84, emphasis
			added)</p>
<p>If Hathorne believed that God protected him or if he knew that those he questioned could
			be innocent cannot be proven either way. Bernard Rosenthal suggests in Salem Story the
			possibility that Hathorne might have also stood to have some financial gain from the
			trials from the seizure of property that took place, and the same with the other judges.
			Whatever his motives for such aggressive prosecution, however, Hathorne put many
			innocent people to death and became the shame of his family even down to his
			great-grandson, Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>

<p>Born in England in 1652, Samuel Sewall moved to America at the age of nine and obtained two degrees from Harvard before marrying into a wealthy family. As a prominent member of the merchant class, Sewall was selected by Governor Phips to sit as a judge for the witchcraft trials on the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Five years after the trials concluded, Sewall issued a public confession demonstrating personal remorse, taking in his words the "Blame and Shame" for his part in condemning innocent people.

<h3>
			Samuel Sewall
		</h3>
<p>Written by Heather E. Jones, revised by D.J. Ward</p>
<p>RELG415: Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001, Fall Semester 2006</p>
<p>One of the nine judges selected to arbitrate the Salem witch trials in 1692, Samuel
			Sewall sat on the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which would condemn nineteen individuals
			to execution by hanging. Almost five years after the trials concluded, Sewall stood in
			front of the congregation of the South Church in Boston while Rev. Samuel Willard read
			his confession aloud. As the only judge from the trials to confess guilt for the part
			that he played in the crisis that took place in Salem in 1692, Samuel Sewall stands as a
			heroic figure in the history of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Samuel Sewall was born in Bishop Stoke, England on March 28, 1652. He immigrated with his
			mother to Newbury, Massachusetts in 1661 on board the ship "Prudent Mary," to join his
			father, Henry Sewall Jr., who came to America four years earlier to claim his deceased
			father's estate. In 1667, he was able to prove his proficiency in Latin and Greek and
			was accepted to Harvard, where he would study for seven years. After receiving his first
			degree in 1671, he continued his studies in the quest for an MA degree. Not only did he
			obtain this degree, but he also meant his wife, Hannah Hull. A relative of the then
			Harvard president, Hull also attended Sewall's MA oral examination. While obtaining such
			a degree usually meant that a man would go into a life in the ministry, Sewall struggled
			with that idea. After marrying Hannah on February 26, 1676, he decided to join the Hull
			family business. Hannah's father John was the mint master and tax collector for
			Massachusetts, which gave him great power and wealth within the colony. Sewall became an
			active apprentice to his father-in-law. There seemed to be a gradual shift of power
			during this time from the pulpit to hands of the wealthy, and Sewall's decision to enter
			business was part of that change.</p>
<p>As Sewall's wealth and power grew, so did his responsibility and commitment to public
			service. While rising through the ranks of the mercantile class, Sewall became a freeman
			of Boston in Mary of 1678. This meant that he was able to vote for the candidates for
			the House of Deputies. In 1681, he became the official colony publisher, and published
			The Pilgrim's Progress, in which "he compensated for rejecting a life in ministry by
			putting out the writings of some of New England's most distinguished clerics"(Francis,
			34). John Hull passed away in 1683, and Sewall took over his business interests. Six
			months later he joined the legislative Council in Boston, one of the bodies of the
			Massachusetts bicameral legislature.</p>
<p>Spending the rest of the 1680s and early 1690s in charge of the family business and
			involved in local government, Sewall was appointed by Governor Sir William Phips as a
			judge on the Court of Oyer and Terminer in May of 1692. Phips had established the Court
			in order to bring to trial those accused of witchcraft. Sewall was a logical choice, as
			he had both high status in the community and a strong theological background. So he
			joined with William Stoughton, Jonathan Corwin, Thomas Danforth, Bartholomew Gentry,
			John Hathorne, John Richards, Nathaniel Saltonstall, and Peter Sargent as the men who
			would serve as judges on the Court. Although only five of the nine judges were needed in
			order to try a case, evidence suggests that Sewall was present for most of the trials.
			The Court condemned nineteen people to their death that year until Governor Phips
			finally closed it down on October 29. Certainly, however, Sewall's investment in the
			issues of that year did not conclude with the trials, as five years later he would issue
			his apology.</p>
<p>While Sewall began to feel remorseful soon after the trials ended, he still commented on
			the presence of witchcraft in society. He noted in his diary on January 19, 1694, that
			Mrs. Prout had passed away, "not without the suspicion of Witchcraft"(Sewall, 74). By no
			means had he stopped believing in witches, only that nothing needed to be made of the
			fact that someone might be a witch. Thus Sewall's apology in 1697 arose out of a genuine
			fear that he had done wrong, not that witches did not exist.</p>
<p>Sewall's confession followed a series of family misfortunes. During the five years that
			followed the trials, two of his daughters, Jane and Sarah died, along with his
			mother-in-law. Hannah also gave birth to a stillborn child during this time, and the
			remorse that Sewall felt over the trials had given him a sense of spiritual darkness.
			With all of this haunting Sewall, he wondered if God was punishing him for his actions
			in 1692. A passage recited by his son Sam on December 24, 1696 spurred him to take
			action. The verse was Matthew 12:7, "If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have
			mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless, " which he said "did
			awfully bring to mind the Salem Tragedie"(Strandness, 75). When January 14, 1697, was
			established as a day of fasting and prayer for the sins of the witchcraft trials, Sewall
			took the chance to issue a formal apology. As Rev. Samuel Willard passed by his pew, he
			handed him a letter, rising as Willard read:</p>
<p>Samuel Sewall, sensible of the reiterated strokes of God upon himself and family; and
			being sensible, that as to the Guilt contracted upon the opening of the late Commission
			of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the order of this Day relates) he is, upon many
			accounts, more concerned than any that he knows of, Desires to take the Blame and shame
			of it, Asking pardon of men, And especially desiring prayers that God, who has an
			Unlimited Authority, would pardon that sin and all other his sins; personal and
			Relative: And according to his infinite Benignity and Sovereignty, Not Visit the sin of
			him, or of any other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the Land: But that he would
			powerfully defend him against all Temptations to Sin, for the future; and vouchsafe him
			the efficacious, saving conduct of his Word and Spirit.</p>
<p>Sewall's apology had certainly been made in earnest, as he genuinely feared the wrath of
			God. While others, including twelve jurors and eventually Cotton Mather and Ann Putnam,
			offered words of contrition none mirrored the importance and feeling of personally
			responsibility of Sewall. Sewall biographer Richard Francis noted that, "What unifies,"
			the confessions of the others, "is that they all see guilt as a matter of external
			manipulation. Parris, the jurors, and Ann Putnam insist that they were well meaning but
			had been deceived and made use of by a malignant power" (Francis, 185). Sewall's apology
			truly stands out against the backdrop of the others, as his showed sense of moral
			conscience and a real feeling of remorse. He would continue to fast one day out of the
			year for the rest of his life as a sign of contrition.</p>
<p>Historian Chadwick Hansen noted that Sewall's apology did not mean that he had totally
			changed his view about witchcraft. Citing a letter that Sewall wrote responding to John
			Hale on November 19, 1697, Hansen explained, "Sewall still regarded witchcraft as a
			punishable capital offense, but recognized that the court of which he had been a
			prominent member had proceeded on unsafe principles and was guilty of shedding innocent
			blood." His feelings about the injustice that he and the rest of the Court had done in
			1692 influenced his work later in life. One specific instance of note came on June 24,
			1700, when he printed a pamphlet against slavery asserting that it was wrong and men and
			women should be treated as material possessions.</p>
<p>While Samuel Sewall was certainly just as responsible for the deaths of nineteen accused
			witches in 1692 as any other member of the Court, he did one thing that none of the
			other judges did: he apologized. Sewall's biographer, Richard Francis has characterized
			the twofold nature of Sewall's now famous apology. "There's particular poignancy in the
			case of a judge" making an apology, "a person whose job it is to supervise the passing
			of a verdict on other people switches that responsibility clear around." But an apology
			"can liberate both an individual and his or her society," freeing him, "from the past
			and giv[ing] access to the future." A large mural size painting of Sewall making his
			apology in front of the South Church congregation hangs in the Massachusetts House of
			Representatives in Boston. The painting is titled "Dawn of Tolerance in Massachusetts.
			Public Repentance of Judge Samuel Sewall for his Action in the witchcraft trials." The
			painting is one of a set of five paintings that collectively are titled, "Milestones on
			the road to freedom in Massachusetts." As Francis has noted, "Apology can be heroic;"
			certainly, Sewall's act has taken on such a role in the history of Massachusetts and the
			Salem witch trials.</p>

			William Stoughton: Chief Justice of the Court of Oyer and Terminer

<p>William Stoughton: Chief Justice of the Court of Oyer and Terminer</p>
<p>
			Introduction
		</p>
<p>The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692 represents a particularly dark time in early American
			history. Gossip and accusations wreaked havoc in Essex County, Massachusetts. After four
			months of legal proceedings, over twenty people had perished by noose, stones, or in
			jail cells. Governor William Phips instituted a Court of Oyer and Terminer in order to
			effectively deal with the excess of accusations. This tribunal became the mechanism by
			which accused witches were systematically tried and sent to their deaths. At the head of
			the court sat William Stoughton, a dour, ascetic character who was raised in a Puritan
			household and guided through life by political ambition. In his lifetime, Stoughton
			served as a minister, a military officer, and a public servant, and a judge.</p>
<p>Stoughton was a hardliner who actively pursued conviction and punishment for the accused
			witches who came through the doors of his courtroom. As head of the special tribunal
			which heard these cases, it was entirely within his power to achieve his goals. One
			biographical account concludes; “Not withstanding the excitement of the time, there can
			be no doubt, that, if Stoughton had been as zealous to procure the acquittal as he was
			to bring about the conviction of the accused, this black page in the history of New
			England and of humanity could nave never been written.”1 Who
			was William Stoughton, and how did he develop such a severe and vindictive courtroom
			manner of conduct? This paper will seek to summarize Stoughton’s life and courtroom
			experience, and to explain his behavior in this context. </p>
<p>
			Biography
		</p>
<p>Accounts vary on Stoughton’s birth place and date, but he was likely born on September
			30th, 16312 in either Dorchester, Massachusetts, or in
				England.3 His father, Israel Stoughton, was one of the
			original settlers of Dorchester. Israel held several prominent positions within the
			community, including selectman, commander of a military company during the Pequot War of
			1637, and a seat on the Governor’s Council. Israel was also an ambitious businessman; he
			constructed the first corn mill in New England. According to History
				of the Town of Dorchester, “the position which he occupied in the affairs of
			the colony and the plantation, points him out as a man of superior intelligence and
			large property.”4
		</p>
<p>In 1635, Israel sat on a committee to examine the accounts of Governor Winthrop of the
			Massachusetts Bay Colony. History of the Town of Dorchester states that Israel enraged
			the Governor and the Governor’s Council by “publishing a pamphlet denying them some of
			the powers they claimed”5. Israel was subsequently
			“disinabled for beareing any publ office in the comonwealth, within this jurisdic-on,
			for the space of three yeares, for affirmeing the Assistants were noe magistrates,”6 according to the General Court Records cited in John Langdon
			Sibley’s Biographical Sketches of Graduates of Harvard
				University. The disability lasted until 1636, at which time he was elected to
			the Governor’s Council and chosen to “command the Pequod expedition.”7 Israel and his troops nearly decimated the Pequot tribe and
			returned to Dorchester in triumph. In 1644, Israel went to England where he “became
			intimate with some leaders or the Revolution.”8 He remained
			committed to that cause until his death in Lincoln, Massachusetts in 1645. Little is
			known about Israel’s personality and beliefs, but he appears to have been “of the rigid
			Puritan school”9 and placed a high value on education. The
			Harvard College Records state that Israel left to his only surviving son, William,
			“’halfe’ of his library ‘for his incouragt to apply himself to studies, especially to
			the holy Scriptures; unto wch they are mostly helpful.’”10
		</p>
<p>Like Israel, who protested the government in a pamphlet, William’s mother Elizabeth
			Clarke also challenged authorities. In 1649, she joined a group of female petitioners
			from Boston and Dorchester on behalf of midwife Alice Tilly. Tilly was accused of
			causing “the deaths of many of her patients, adults and babies alike,”11 according to an article by Mary Beth Norton in The William and Mary Quarterly. The petition called for the
			authorities to allow Tilly to continue practicing midwifery without posting bail.
			William was surely influenced by both Israel and Elizabeth’s political activism and
			willingness to challenge government and judicial proceedings. Indeed, he too criticized
			and challenged the colonial government several times throughout his life.</p>
<p>Stoughton attended Harvard College, where he studied divinity. After his gradation in
			1650, he went to England where he earned a Master of Arts and a Fellowship at Oxford. In
			1662, Stoughton lost his Fellowship as a result of the Restoration of King Charles II,
			and returned to New England. Upon his return, he assisted the aged Increase Mather in
			his ministerial duties. This relationship sparked a friendship between Stoughton and
			both Increase Mather and his son, Cotton. Both of these men would influence Stoughton’s
			courtroom decisions during the witchcraft trials. Stoughton declined numerous requests
			take Increase’s place and “minister the Dorchester or Cambridge churches,”12 according to an article by Richard Johnson in American National Biography Online.</p>
<p>Stoughton shirked the ministry in favor of politics, and held a range of prestigious
			positions within the colony. In History of the Town of
				Dorchester, Ebenezer Clapp surmises that “it is not unlikely that [Stoughton’s]
			future greatness began to dawn upon him, and he decided not to commit himself to a
			profession that was then considered so sacred, so enduring, and so difficult to resign,
			as the clerical.”13 He was appointed to the office of
			Commissioner of the United Colonies from 1674 until 1676, and again from 1680 until
			1686. He served as Deputy President of Massachusetts Bay Colony under Joseph Dudley, his
			“warm friend” 14and political ally, according to Sibley’s
				Biographical Sketches of Graduates of Harvard University.
			Johnson states that Stoughton and Dudley were political moderates who “urged
			accommodation to English regulation,”15 instead of stiff
			opposition to the Massachusetts charter, which would have brought the colony under
			greater control under the Crown.</p>
<p>Stoughton continued to serve as Deputy President under Sir Edmund Andros, the royal
			governor sent by England to oversee colonial affairs in late 1686. When the citizens of
			Massachusetts rebelled against Andros in 1689 in reaction to the Glorious Revolution in
			England, Stoughton distanced himself from Andros in order to save his political
			reputation. Stoughton joined with several members of Andros’ council in denouncing the
			former governor in a document titled A Narrative of the Proceedings
				of Sir Edmond Androsse and his Complices. According to this document,
			“Innumerable were the evil Effects that from hence were continually growing up amongst
				us”16 during Andros’ tenure. Grievances included that
			“the Governour did so quickly neglect the great number of the Council,” that “the
			Debates in Council were not so free as ought to have been,”17 and that “the Greatest Rigour and Severity was too often used towards the
			soberest sort of People.”18 A shrewd politician, Stoughton
			was quick to form and abandon political alliances in order to further his own
			ambitions.</p>
<p>Stoughton was present on the Maine frontier in 1688 when the Second Indian War broke out.
			Along with other members of Andros’ council, Stoughton was responsible for arming the
			militia and ordering attacks and seizure of the Wabanakis. This move proved disastrous
			when the Wabanakis retaliated by kidnapping sixteen English settlers. Andros’ Council
			charged Stoughton with settling a prisoner exchange, which he failed to do “for reasons
			that remain obscure,”19 according to Mary Beth Norton in
				In the Devil’s Snare. Stoughton returned to Boston and soon
			after, four of the English captives were killed. In 1687, Stoughton presided over a
			dispute settlement in Falmouth, Maine. Instead of negotiating a resolution, Stoughton
			attacked one litigant for defaming Edward Tyng, one of Stoughton’s fellow council
			members. Norton concludes that “the picture of a man certain of his judgments and
			unwilling to entertain any opposition is confirmed by every fragment of surviving
			evidence about the chief justice’s conduct during the witchcraft trials.”20</p>
<p>Stoughton enjoyed a close relationship with Increase and Cotton Mather, who were
			ministers and prominent figures in Massachusetts Bay politics. When Increase was in
			England trying to negotiate a new charter for the colonies, his son Cotton wrote to him
			that “’Mr. Stoughton is a real friend to New-England, and willing to make any amendment
			for the miscarriages of the late government.’”21 Increase
			recommended that Stoughton be given the commission of Lieutenant Governor under Sir
			William Phips, and this stipulation was subsequently included in the charter drafted in
			England in 1691. According to Peter Hoffer in The Salem Witchcraft
				Trials, when Phips arrived in mid-May of 1692, the Colony was “teetering on the
			brink of chaos”22 . This was due to a major witchcraft
			scandal raging in Salem and several surrounding towns. Phips almost immediately
			appointed Stoughton as Chief Justice of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, the special
			tribunal to set up to hear witchcraft cases. Stoughton retained the position of Chief
			Justice nearly until his death in 1701.</p>
<p>In 1694, Governor Phips was recalled to England. Johnson states that Stoughton once again
			played a role in deriding his former superior by “quietly help[ing] to gather evidence
			for the charges of maladministration”23 against Phips. From
			the time of Phips’ removal, Stoughton acted as Commander-in-Chief of the Colony until
			his death in Dorchester on July 7th, 1701. He never married, and in his will he left his
			considerable estate to his church in Dorchester and to “’Harvard College at Cambridge,
			the place of my first public education, (which nursery of good learning hath been so
			inestimable blessing to the Church and the people of God in this wilderness…),’”24 according to the Harvard College Records.</p>
<p>
			The Witchcraft Trials
		</p>
<p>The Reverend Samuel Parris and his family arrived in Salem, Massachusetts in 1689. Born
			in Barbados and educated at Harvard College, Parris took over the pulpit of the Salem
			church at a time when tensions were high among the factions of Salem citizenry. Rifts
			were growing between residents of urbanized Salem Town and agrarian Salem Village. In
			Puritan settlements like Salem, the church stood at the center of society, and church
			proceedings subsequently became politicized. In the two decades prior to the breakout of
			the witchcraft trials, three ministers had passed through Salem. In each case, one
			faction pledged to support the minister while the other voiced strong opposition. All
			three ministers left in the face of growing hostility from those who opposed them. Salem
			Village lacked a concrete system of government and court system, and citizens often
			turned towards the minister to resolve disputes. It was under these circumstances that
			Samuel Parris took on the role of minister.25</p>
<p>During the frigid New England winter of 1691, Parris’ daughter Betty and niece Abigail
			Williams fell ill. Parris consulted Dr. William Griggs, who observed the girls’ strange
			symptoms and attributed the illness to witchcraft.26 In A Further Account of the Tryals of the New England Witches, the
			Reverend Increase Mather recalled a visit to the home of Samuel Parris to observe the
			girls’ bizarre afflictions. He wrote, “In the beginning of the Evening I went to give
			Mr. P. a Visit. When I was there, his Kinswoman, Abigail Williams, (about 12 Years of
			Age) had a grievous fit; she was at first hurried with violence to and fro in
			the…sometimes making as if she would fly, stretching up her Arms as high as she
				could…”27 Accusations began to fly. Several more girls
			and women in the community started to experience similar fits and make witchcraft
			accusations against neighbors in Salem. The witch-hunt expanded with incredible speed
			and by May of 1692, new accusations were arising on a daily basis. People who were
			accused of practicing witchcraft were jailed. Two county magistrates, acting as Justices
			of the Peace, were called on to conduct examinations. According Hoffer, “the tidal wave
			of accusations overwhelmed the institutions of criminal justice that had, until now,
			served the colony adequately.”28 It was in light of this
			situation that Governor Phips established the special Court of Oyer and Terminer.</p>
<p>The Court of Oyer and Terminer consisted of nine men in total; several had acted as
			justices under the Court of Assistants that had been established under the old charter.
			The other members were prominent Massachusetts figures as well. According to the new
			charter issued by the Crown, the justices were supposed to conform to English law in all
			court decisions. English law, however, did not concretely define evidence or provide
			standards for legal proof. Indeed, at the end of seventeenth century, “juries in England
			were still treated to a mixture of rumor, supposition, lies, tall tales, and personal
				spite,”29 Hoffer states. The colonial courts were no
			different. Witchcraft cases also raised additional questions in regard to admissibility
			of evidence. Witchcraft was a “hidden crime” which took place in an “invisible
				world.”30 Therefore, the justices had no concrete
			evidence to look at, but were forced to rely on prejudicial accounts given by accusers
			such as the afflicted girls and women of Salem Village. The question thus arose of
			whether spectral evidence could be admissible in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Both Increase and Cotton Mather gave serious consideration to the question of the
			admissibility of spectral evidence, but father and son diverged in their opinions. In
				A Further Account of the Tryals of the New England Witches,
			Increase poses the question: “Whether not may Satan appear in the Shape of an Innocent
			and Pious, as well as of a Nocent and Wicked Person, to afflict such as suffer by
			Diabolical Molestation?”31 He answers in the affirmative
			and backs his argument with citations from history and the Bible. He thus makes the case
			because specters can appear in the shapes of innocent people, that spectral evidence
			should not be admitted in the courtroom. On the other hand, Cotton firmly believed that
			the Devil stood behind “ye horrible witchcrafts among us,”32 and that spectral evidence strengthened the cases before the court. In a
			letter to John Foster, a member of Phips’ council, Mather wrote, “A very great use is to
			bee made of the spectral impressions upon the sufferers. They Justly Introduce, and
			Determine, an Enquiry into the circumstances of the person accused; and they strengthen
			other presumptions.”33 Cotton stressed that no suspect
			should be condemned on spectral evidence alone, given the slim chance that a specter
			might actually appear as an innocent person. He ultimately reasoned that the strongest
			form of evidence was a confession from an alleged witch.34</p>
<p>
			The Hon'ble William Stoughton Esq'r Cheif Justice
		</p>
<p>As Chief Justice of the special tribunal, Stoughton played a dominant role in the court
			proceedings. Given Stoughton’s close friendship with Cotton Mather, in addition to
			fervent Puritan background and his political ambitions, it is not surprising that
			Stoughton decided to admit spectral evidence in his courtroom. “Stoughton was in full
			sympathy with Cotton Mather,”35 states Charles Upham in Witchcraft at Salem Village. Both men believed that God would
			not allow specters to take on the forms of innocent people, so anyone who was seen in
			the form of a specter was indeed guilty. By making this exception, Stoughton provided
			additional grounds on which the court could convict accused witches. He was anxious to
			cleanse the community of supernatural afflictions, and spectral evidence implicated more
			people and strengthened existing cases. In response to Cotton Mather’s Wonders of the Invisible World, which expounded Cotton’s views
			on spectral evidence, Stoughton wrote: </p>
<p>Having now perused so happy and fruitful a composure, upon such a subject, at this
			juncture of time, and considering the place that I hold in the Court of Oyer and
			Terminer, still laboring and proceeding in the trial of the persons accused and
			convicted for witchcraft, I find that I am more nearly and highly concerned than as a
			meer ordinary reader to express my obligation and thankfulness to you for so great
			pains; and cannot but hold myself many ways bound, even to the utmost of what is proper
			for me, in my present publick capacity, to express my singular approbation thereof.36</p>
<p>In Witchcraft at Salem Village, Charles Upham describes the
			division of opinion between those who “maintained that the Devil could employ only the
			spectres of persons in league with him; others affirmed, that he could send upon his
			evil errands the spectres of innocent persons, without their consent or knowledge.”37 He notes that Chief Justice Stoughton dogmatically held on
			to the former opinion, “against the judgment of many others, arbitrarily established it
			as a rule of the Court, and peremptorily instructed juries to regard it as binding upon
			them in making their verdicts.”38 This rule led to
			inevitable verdicts of “guilty” for many of the prisoners. </p>
<p>Stoughton’s zealous courtroom mentality is evidenced by other sources as well. Thomas
			Brattle, a Harvard-educated Boston merchant who witnessed the witchcraft trials,
			described Stoughton’s instructions to the jury in a letter to “some clerical
				correspondent”39 of unknown identity in October of
			1692. At the trial of Bridget Bishop, the first accused witch to face judgment,
			Stoughton told the jury “not to mind whether the bodies of the said afflicted were pined
			and consumed… but whether the said afflicted did not suffer from the accused such
			afflictions as naturally tended to their being pined and
			consumed. This, (said he) is a pining and consuming in the sense of the law.”40 Brattle continued to criticize the tyrannical behavior of
			Stoughton on the bench; “The chief Judge is very zealous in these proceedings, and says,
			he is very clear as to all that hath as yet been enacted by this Court, and, as far as I
			could ever perceive, is very impatient in hearing anything that looks another way.”41</p>
<p>During the trial of Rebecca Nurse, a highly regarded elderly church member, Stoughton was
			displeased when the jury initially returned with a verdict of “not guilty.” He
			intervened by telling the jury to reconsider Nurse’s statement “What, do these persons
			give in evidence against me now, they used to come among us.”42 According to a declaration by Thomas Fisk, a member of the jury, “When
			the Verdict not Guilty was, the honoured Court was pleased to object against it.”43 The jury was sent out to reconsider its earlier decision.
			Nurse was asked to clarify her statement, but being“old and hard of hearing,” she did
			not understand and failed to explain herself. The jury returned a second time with a
			“guilty” verdict, and Nurse was executed some two weeks later.</p>
<p>Even before the trial of Rebecca Nurse, people were beginning to question the
			admissibility of spectral evidence. In mid-June, two weeks prior to Nurse’s trial,
			thirteen New England ministers, led by the Reverend Samuel Willard, asked Cotton Mather
			to draft a letter later titled “Return of Several Ministers.” The intention of the
			letter was to ask the justices to stop admitting spectral evidence in the trials.
			However, as seen earlier, Cotton actually supported the use of spectral evidence.
			Therefore, the final paragraph of the letter, which “Mather had undoubtedly written on
			his own,”44 called the “speedy and vigorous prosecution” of
			Bridget Bishop “obnoxious,” but did not actually condemn the trials.45 While the intent of the other ministers was to end the use
			of spectral evidence in the court, Cotton Mather altered the message to obscure its
			meaning and perhaps to support his friend Stoughton.</p>
<p>In early October, Increase Mather penned a document entitled Cases of
				Conscience which condemned the use of spectral evidence in no uncertain terms.
			He wrote that witchcraft should be equated with other felonious crimes, and the quality
			of evidence should be the same in all serious cases, regardless of supernatural nature.
			The document states that while it is more difficult to prove that someone is a witch
			without relying on spectral evidence to some degree, “nor yet that any other means
			should be used for the discovery of Witches than what may be used for the finding out of
			Murderers, Adulterers, and other Criminals.”46 According to
			Sibley’s Biographical Sketches of Graduates of Harvard
				University, in response to both the document and to mounting pressure against
			the “bigoted zeal”47 with which Stoughtonwas leading the
			Court, Governor Phips immediately ordered the Court of Oyer and Terminer to stop
			admitting spectral evidence and stayed the executions of five jailed convicts. Robert
			Calef reports in Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases that when
			Stoughton found out about the cancelled executions, he responded, “We were in a way to
			have cleared the land of these, etc., who it is obstructs the course of Justice I know
			not; the Lord be merciful to the Countrey,”48 and “so went
			off the bench; and came no more to the court.”49</p>
<p>By mid-October, Phips finally notified his superiors in England of the crisis, and by the
			end of October, he dissolved the Court entirely. In a letter from Phips addressed “To
			the Rt. Honble the Earle of Nottingham at Whitehall,” in which Phips explains the chain
			of events and attempts to exonerate himself. He states that when he gave the order to
			stay the executions,“The Lieut. Gov. upon this occasion was inraged and filled with
			passionate anger and refused to sitt upon the bench in a Superior Court…”50 Unlike Stoughton’s fellow justice Samuel Sewall, who later
			issued a public apology for the errors of the court, Stoughton refused to do the same.
			In The History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Thomas
			Hutchinson writes that: </p>
<p>The chief justice, Mr. Stoughton, being informed of this action of one of his brethren,
			observed for himself that, when he sat in judgment, he had the fear of God before his
			eyes and gave his opinion according to the best of his understanding; although it might
			appear afterwards, that he had been in an error, yet he saw no necessity of a public
			acknowledgment of it.51</p>
<p>Thus came to an end the Salem witchcraft trials and the Stoughton’s reign of tyranny as
			Chief Judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. He continued on as the head of the
			revised Massachusetts court system, but under an altered set of rules which did not
			admit spectral evidence and had a significantly lower rate of conviction.52</p>
<p>
			Conclusion
		</p>
<p>It is impossible to make definitive claims about William Stoughton’s harsh behavior based
			on the relatively sparse number of primary documents available from the late seventeenth
			century. However, given the information that can be gathered on the events of
			Stoughton’s life, it is possible to draw some general conclusions about the reasons
			behind his severe courtroom comportment. Stoughton grew up in a Puritan household with
			politically active parents who placed a high value on education. During his childhood,
			both his mother and father were involved with political and judicial proceedings in the
			colony, and Stoughton’s political career was surely influenced by his parents’ actions.
			Although he craftily avoided direct confrontations with Governors Andros and Phips,
			Stoughton co-wrote petitions against both men which ultimately led to their deposals.
			Stoughton followed closely in the footsteps of his father in other ways as well, holding
			several important political and military positions in the colony. Religion clearly
			played a fundamental role in Stoughton’s upbringing; he studied divinity, assisted the
			Reverend Increase Mather, and nearly became a minister. When the witchcraft crisis was
			blamed on the Devil, Stoughton must have believed it was his duty to cleanse Salem of
			the Devil’s work.</p>
<p>One interpretation of Stoughton’s rash behavior and vehemence for conviction comes from
				In the Devil’s Snare by Mary Beth Norton. Norton states that
			the conviction of Rebecca Nurse (and others) was remarkable not only because of
			Stoughton’s “influential insistence that a specter could not represent an innocent
			person,” but also because of “his consequent outspoken belief in the guilt of anyone who
			was so represented.”53 She counters that the authorities of
			Massachusetts Bay Colony truly believed that the Devil was behind the misfortunes which
			had befallen them, from failed military campaign against the Indians in Maine to the
			current witchcraft crisis. Thus, by rashly pursuing and quickly convicting accused
			witches, Stoughton and his fellow judges believed they were aggressively combating the
				Devil.54 This interpretation has merit especially when
			one considers the terror which the Indian wars instilled in the frontier settlers.
			Stoughton was partially responsible for the failed military campaign which led to the
			Second Indian War, and he was unable to successfully negotiate the prisoner exchange.
			Thus, his courtroom severity can be interpreted as an attempt to make up for past
			failures to protect the colony. </p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of Stoughton’s character is his seeming obsession with power.
			He embarked on an ambitious political career at a young age. He was a fickle friend to
			both Andros and Phips, whom he turned his back on when their regimes collapsed. Charles
			Upham comments that “all administrative, legislative, judicial, and military powers were
			concentrated in [Stoughton’s] person and wielded by his hand.”55 Indeed, Stoughton was a power-hungry individual in all respects, although
			his military and judicial shortcomings indicate that he was not necessarily qualified to
			hold so many positions. His penchant for power extended into his courtroom, where he
			“conducted the trials, all along, with a spirit that bears the aspect of
				animosity,”56 according to Upham.</p>
<p>The lasting impression of William Stoughton is that of a Puritan Ebenezer Scrooge; nasty,
			controlling, vindictive, and lonely. He is almost an ideal figure to have led the Court
			of Oyer and Terminer, which turned innocent citizens into witches, ripe for hanging.
			Indeed, his stubborn views on spectral evidence shaped the decisions of the court. Even
			after the trials had ended and other participants realized the mistakes they had made,
			Stoughton refused to acknowledge that he had committed a single error. Charles Upham
			writes that the Court of Oyer and Terminer “scatter[ed] destruction, ruin, terror,
			misery and death over the country,”57 and as chief justice
			of that tribunal, William Stoughton was the impetus behind it all.</p>

<h3>John Hathorne</h3>
<p>Born into a well-established Salem family on August 5, 1641, 
    John Hathorne became a local Salem magistrate and was chosen by Governor Sir 
    William Phips to be a judge in the Salem Witch Trials. During the trials, 
    Hathorne took on the role of a prosecutor rather than an impartial judge. 
    Hathorne's questioning always began with a presumption of guilt rather than 
    innocence, and he appeared to be on the side of the accusers. Hathorne altered 
    the tradition of previous witch trials by encouraging those under examination 
    not only to confess to witchcraft but also to name others who might be witches 
    - a move that accelerated the number of accusations. He died in Salem on May 
    10, 1717, and was later a prominent target of criticism by his own great-grandson, 
    Nathaniel Hawthorne. </p>

<h3>
			John Hathorne
		</h3>
<p>By Devan Kirk</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>On August 5, 1641, John Hathorne was born into a community that could have little
			suspected his future role in the condemnation and death of so many people. His prominent
			ancestry in Salem led him to acquire positions of justice of the peace and county judge.
			As a religious man in a highly religious community, Hathorne, like others, believed that
			the devil had the power to influence people to do harm in the community and in the
			church. Hathorne allowed his strong, unexamined, beliefs to influence him during his
			time as judge in the Salem Witchcraft Trials, thus making him take on an avid
			prosecutorial style and an assumption of guilt of most of those who answered his
			questions.</p>
<p>Usually, Hathorne began his questioning in an accusatory tone, and he would then proceed
			to badger the accused in an attempt to drive out a confession and, better yet, more
			accusations. Although these methods were a departure from tradition, Hathorne used them
			throughout the trials. One classic example of Hathorne at work as a judge is the
			examination of Rebecca Nurse. He begins not by asking Nurse if she is guilty or
			innocent, but by asking the afflicted if Nurse afflicts them. He then asks Rebecca,
			"here are two An: Putman the child &amp; Abigail Williams complains of your hurting them
			What do you say to it" and Nurse replies that she is innocent." Hathorne, of course,
			does not let it rest at that. He continues, "Here is never a one in the Assembly but
			desires it, but if you be guilty Pray God discover you" and then allows the people in
			the room to stand and testify as to how Nurse afflicted each of them, relentlessly
			asking Rebecca after each how and if she denies them. He persists, asking, "You see
			these accuse you, is it true?" in response to which Nurse states "No," but, not being
			the answer that Hathorne desired he asks again, "Are you an innocent person relating to
			this Witchcraft." Hathorne then continued to allow the accusations of others to be heard
			until Rebecca Nurse cried, "Oh Lord help me, &amp; spread out her hands, &amp; the
			afflicted were grievously vexed" to which Hathorne replies in his usual accusatory
			manner, "Do you not see what a solemn condition these are in? when your hands are loose
			the persons are afflicted." Frustrated by her continued claim of innocence, Hathorne
			states, "It is very awful to all to see these agonies &amp; you an old Professor
			[believer] thus charged with contracting with the Devil by the [a] effects of it &amp;
			yet to see you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet" to which Rebecca Nurse
			courageously asserts "You do not know my heart." It is here that Hathorne slips in his
			composure and openly states, "You would do well if you are guilty to confess &amp; give
			Glory to God" - thus showing his already formed opinion as to her guilt and his
			preference for confessions. The questioning then continues and Hathorne switches into a
			new mode and attempts to trick Nurse into confessing, "Possibly you [Nurse] may
			apprehend you are no witch, but have you not been led aside by temptations that way"
			for, if Nurse confessed to either, she would be confessing at least to the practice of
			witchcraft still, and could still be punished. Again the badgering by Hathorne continued
			until finally Nurse asked a revealing question to which she received no answer, "Would
			you [Hathorne] have me belie my self." This questioned posed to Hathorne shows that
			Nurse suspected that Hathorne desired her to confess even though she was innocent, and
			her brave questioning of him ended the examination.</p>
<p>Hathorne's role in the trials leaves room for questioning his motives for participating.
			Prior to Governor Phip's arrival in Massachusetts, both Hathorne and Corwin had actively
			jailed many who were suspected of witchcraft, thus setting the scene for each man to be
			biased toward the guilt of those accused. Hathorne also appeared strangely calm while
			questioning those accused of acting in the devil's name. Even Bridget Bishop wondered
			why he did not fear that she would harm him if she was a witch: Hathorne: How can you
			[Bridget Bishop] know, you are no Witch, &amp; yet not know what a Witch is. Bridget
			Bishop: I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it. (SWP I: 84, emphasis
			added)</p>
<p>If Hathorne believed that God protected him or if he knew that those he questioned could
			be innocent cannot be proven either way. Bernard Rosenthal suggests in Salem Story the
			possibility that Hathorne might have also stood to have some financial gain from the
			trials from the seizure of property that took place, and the same with the other judges.
			Whatever his motives for such aggressive prosecution, however, Hathorne put many
			innocent people to death and became the shame of his family even down to his
			great-grandson, Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>

<h3>Samuel Sewall</h3>
<p>Born in England in 1652, Samuel Sewall moved to America at the age of nine and obtained two degrees from Harvard before marrying into a wealthy family. As a prominent member of the merchant class, Sewall was selected by Governor Phips to sit as a judge for the witchcraft trials on the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Five years after the trials concluded, Sewall issued a public confession demonstrating personal remorse, taking in his words the "Blame and Shame" for his part in condemning innocent people.

<h3>
			Samuel Sewall
		</h3>
<p>Written by Heather E. Jones, revised by D.J. Ward</p>
<p>RELG415: Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001, Fall Semester 2006</p>
<p>One of the nine judges selected to arbitrate the Salem witch trials in 1692, Samuel
			Sewall sat on the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which would condemn nineteen individuals
			to execution by hanging. Almost five years after the trials concluded, Sewall stood in
			front of the congregation of the South Church in Boston while Rev. Samuel Willard read
			his confession aloud. As the only judge from the trials to confess guilt for the part
			that he played in the crisis that took place in Salem in 1692, Samuel Sewall stands as a
			heroic figure in the history of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Samuel Sewall was born in Bishop Stoke, England on March 28, 1652. He immigrated with his
			mother to Newbury, Massachusetts in 1661 on board the ship "Prudent Mary," to join his
			father, Henry Sewall Jr., who came to America four years earlier to claim his deceased
			father's estate. In 1667, he was able to prove his proficiency in Latin and Greek and
			was accepted to Harvard, where he would study for seven years. After receiving his first
			degree in 1671, he continued his studies in the quest for an MA degree. Not only did he
			obtain this degree, but he also meant his wife, Hannah Hull. A relative of the then
			Harvard president, Hull also attended Sewall's MA oral examination. While obtaining such
			a degree usually meant that a man would go into a life in the ministry, Sewall struggled
			with that idea. After marrying Hannah on February 26, 1676, he decided to join the Hull
			family business. Hannah's father John was the mint master and tax collector for
			Massachusetts, which gave him great power and wealth within the colony. Sewall became an
			active apprentice to his father-in-law. There seemed to be a gradual shift of power
			during this time from the pulpit to hands of the wealthy, and Sewall's decision to enter
			business was part of that change.</p>
<p>As Sewall's wealth and power grew, so did his responsibility and commitment to public
			service. While rising through the ranks of the mercantile class, Sewall became a freeman
			of Boston in Mary of 1678. This meant that he was able to vote for the candidates for
			the House of Deputies. In 1681, he became the official colony publisher, and published
			The Pilgrim's Progress, in which "he compensated for rejecting a life in ministry by
			putting out the writings of some of New England's most distinguished clerics"(Francis,
			34). John Hull passed away in 1683, and Sewall took over his business interests. Six
			months later he joined the legislative Council in Boston, one of the bodies of the
			Massachusetts bicameral legislature.</p>
<p>Spending the rest of the 1680s and early 1690s in charge of the family business and
			involved in local government, Sewall was appointed by Governor Sir William Phips as a
			judge on the Court of Oyer and Terminer in May of 1692. Phips had established the Court
			in order to bring to trial those accused of witchcraft. Sewall was a logical choice, as
			he had both high status in the community and a strong theological background. So he
			joined with William Stoughton, Jonathan Corwin, Thomas Danforth, Bartholomew Gentry,
			John Hathorne, John Richards, Nathaniel Saltonstall, and Peter Sargent as the men who
			would serve as judges on the Court. Although only five of the nine judges were needed in
			order to try a case, evidence suggests that Sewall was present for most of the trials.
			The Court condemned nineteen people to their death that year until Governor Phips
			finally closed it down on October 29. Certainly, however, Sewall's investment in the
			issues of that year did not conclude with the trials, as five years later he would issue
			his apology.</p>
<p>While Sewall began to feel remorseful soon after the trials ended, he still commented on
			the presence of witchcraft in society. He noted in his diary on January 19, 1694, that
			Mrs. Prout had passed away, "not without the suspicion of Witchcraft"(Sewall, 74). By no
			means had he stopped believing in witches, only that nothing needed to be made of the
			fact that someone might be a witch. Thus Sewall's apology in 1697 arose out of a genuine
			fear that he had done wrong, not that witches did not exist.</p>
<p>Sewall's confession followed a series of family misfortunes. During the five years that
			followed the trials, two of his daughters, Jane and Sarah died, along with his
			mother-in-law. Hannah also gave birth to a stillborn child during this time, and the
			remorse that Sewall felt over the trials had given him a sense of spiritual darkness.
			With all of this haunting Sewall, he wondered if God was punishing him for his actions
			in 1692. A passage recited by his son Sam on December 24, 1696 spurred him to take
			action. The verse was Matthew 12:7, "If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have
			mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless, " which he said "did
			awfully bring to mind the Salem Tragedie"(Strandness, 75). When January 14, 1697, was
			established as a day of fasting and prayer for the sins of the witchcraft trials, Sewall
			took the chance to issue a formal apology. As Rev. Samuel Willard passed by his pew, he
			handed him a letter, rising as Willard read:</p>
<p>Samuel Sewall, sensible of the reiterated strokes of God upon himself and family; and
			being sensible, that as to the Guilt contracted upon the opening of the late Commission
			of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the order of this Day relates) he is, upon many
			accounts, more concerned than any that he knows of, Desires to take the Blame and shame
			of it, Asking pardon of men, And especially desiring prayers that God, who has an
			Unlimited Authority, would pardon that sin and all other his sins; personal and
			Relative: And according to his infinite Benignity and Sovereignty, Not Visit the sin of
			him, or of any other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the Land: But that he would
			powerfully defend him against all Temptations to Sin, for the future; and vouchsafe him
			the efficacious, saving conduct of his Word and Spirit.</p>
<p>Sewall's apology had certainly been made in earnest, as he genuinely feared the wrath of
			God. While others, including twelve jurors and eventually Cotton Mather and Ann Putnam,
			offered words of contrition none mirrored the importance and feeling of personally
			responsibility of Sewall. Sewall biographer Richard Francis noted that, "What unifies,"
			the confessions of the others, "is that they all see guilt as a matter of external
			manipulation. Parris, the jurors, and Ann Putnam insist that they were well meaning but
			had been deceived and made use of by a malignant power" (Francis, 185). Sewall's apology
			truly stands out against the backdrop of the others, as his showed sense of moral
			conscience and a real feeling of remorse. He would continue to fast one day out of the
			year for the rest of his life as a sign of contrition.</p>
<p>Historian Chadwick Hansen noted that Sewall's apology did not mean that he had totally
			changed his view about witchcraft. Citing a letter that Sewall wrote responding to John
			Hale on November 19, 1697, Hansen explained, "Sewall still regarded witchcraft as a
			punishable capital offense, but recognized that the court of which he had been a
			prominent member had proceeded on unsafe principles and was guilty of shedding innocent
			blood." His feelings about the injustice that he and the rest of the Court had done in
			1692 influenced his work later in life. One specific instance of note came on June 24,
			1700, when he printed a pamphlet against slavery asserting that it was wrong and men and
			women should be treated as material possessions.</p>
<p>While Samuel Sewall was certainly just as responsible for the deaths of nineteen accused
			witches in 1692 as any other member of the Court, he did one thing that none of the
			other judges did: he apologized. Sewall's biographer, Richard Francis has characterized
			the twofold nature of Sewall's now famous apology. "There's particular poignancy in the
			case of a judge" making an apology, "a person whose job it is to supervise the passing
			of a verdict on other people switches that responsibility clear around." But an apology
			"can liberate both an individual and his or her society," freeing him, "from the past
			and giv[ing] access to the future." A large mural size painting of Sewall making his
			apology in front of the South Church congregation hangs in the Massachusetts House of
			Representatives in Boston. The painting is titled "Dawn of Tolerance in Massachusetts.
			Public Repentance of Judge Samuel Sewall for his Action in the witchcraft trials." The
			painting is one of a set of five paintings that collectively are titled, "Milestones on
			the road to freedom in Massachusetts." As Francis has noted, "Apology can be heroic;"
			certainly, Sewall's act has taken on such a role in the history of Massachusetts and the
			Salem witch trials.</p>

<h3>Thomas Brattle</h3>
<p>Thomas Brattle (1658 - 1713) was a well-educated and prosperous 
    Boston merchant who served as treasurer of Harvard College, and was a member 
    of the intellectually elite Royal Society. In early October 1692 he wrote 
    a letter to an English clergyman which was critical of the Salem witch trials. 
    The letter was circulated widely in Boston at the time, and it continues to 
    be studied for its reasoned attack on the witchcraft trials in Salem. Brattle 
    presents a compelling argument against the legal premises and procedures involved 
    in the afflictions, accusations, and executions, with a particular focus on 
    the validity of spectral evidence in proceedings. He was careful not to argue 
    against the motives of the "Salem Gentlemen" as he calls the judges and ministers 
    at the helm, but rather against the methods they employed. He concludes by 
    saying "I am afraid that ages will not wear off that reproach and those stains 
    which these things will leave behind them upon out land."

<h3>
			Thomas Brattle
		</h3>
<p>Written By Mathew Madden</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Thomas Brattle, born in 1658, was "an opulent and cultivated Boston merchant" and a
			generous Harvard alumnus. Made treasurer in 1693, a post that he held for twenty years,
			the college grew in fiscal strength. Brattle was also a noted amateur astronomer and
			mathematician, and a member of the Royal Society. In 1699, following the principles of
			religious toleration established by the new royal charter, he quietly organized the
			Brattle Street Church, which tended toward the teachings of the Church of England
			instead of staunchly Puritan doctrine.</p>
<p>Brattle's significance to the Salem witchcraft outbreak stems mainly from his authorship
			on October 8, 1692 of a widely read Letter sent to an unknown "clerical correspondent,"
			which denounced the foundations on which the accusations, arrests, trials, and
			executions were conducted in Salem. It was sent only five days after the circulation of
			Increase Mather's book Cases of Conscience that denied the theological validity of
			spectral evidence. Brattle, a liberal in both politics and religion, provided a
			secularized perspective on the trials. According to Perry Miller, Brattle's letter was
			"the first treatment of the disaster that step[ped] outside the scheme of the jeremiad"
			(New England Mind). Due to the "highly literate and satirical tone" of Brattle's Letter,
			Perry Miller refers to it as "a milestone in American literature." While Brattle makes
			very clear his complete agreement with Mather's Cases, a comparison of the tone and
			focus of these two works is exemplary of the developing departure from Puritanism then
			underway in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>
<p>In his Letter Brattle focuses most of his account on the method of the madness. He
			describes to his English correspondent the nature of the accusations, examinations, and
			trials, and he brings to the attention of the "Salem Gentlemen" some of the public
			criticism against the trials. First, the method of proving guilt by requiring the
			accused to relieve the suffering of the afflicted in court by a touch of the hand was of
			special concern to Brattle. "I cannot but condemn this method of the Justices, of making
			this touch of the hand a rule to discover witchcraft; because I am fully persuaded that
			it is sorcery, and a superstitious method, and that which we have no rule for, either
			from reason or religion." Here, the place of reason before religion was more than a
			stylistic device, but a method of analysis. Brattle further writes that this kind of
			"sorcery" and "superstition" is not fit to be named a new philosophy "in a land of such
			light as New England" and that "the reasonable part of the world, when acquainted
			herewith, will laugh at the demonstration, and conclude that the said [Salem Gentlemen]
			are actually possessed, at least with ignorance and folly."</p>
<p>Second, Brattle turns his attention to the nature and validity of confessing witches. In
			a methodical argument, Brattle finds that these confessors are "unfit to be evidence
			either against themselves, or any one else" and that they "do very often contradict
			themselves, as inconsistently as is usual for any crazed, distempered person to do."
			Hoping that the people of the colony will join him in rationally appreciating the
			desperate situation the confessed "witches" are in, Brattle argues that "his neighbors"
			will "be soon convinced that there is nothing at all in these arguings, if they would
			but duly consider of the premises."</p>
<p>Finally, he looks at the indictments and trials themselves. He assails the use of
			spectral evidence by the Magistrates and Jury, but does so on legal rather than
			theological grounds. He finds that despite the denials made by the Salem supporters of
			the trials, spectral evidence is the basis on which innocent people are convicted.
			Therefore, Brattle writes that the most recently executed "went out of this world not
			only with as great protestations, but also with as good shews of innocency, as men could
			do."</p>
<p>After excoriating the substance and basis of the trials, Brattle continued to denounce a
			number of associated practices. He noted the ability of some accused to escape arrest
			and persecution by virtue of their high social position or family relationships. Many
			were allowed to escape while others were hounded into the jails. Additionally, Brattle
			attacked the practice of recruiting the advice of the afflicted girls in rooting out
			witchcraft, pointing specifically to the circumstances in Andover that does "now rue the
			day that ever the afflicted [girls from Salem Village] went among them". However,
			Brattle aimed his most scathing criticism at the effect of this hysteria on the
			liberties and freedoms enjoyed among men in the colony. "Liberty was evermore accounted
			the great privilege of an Englishman; but certainly if the devil will be heard against
			us, and his testimony taken to the seizing and apprehending of us, our liberty vanishes,
			and we are fools if we boast of our liberty."</p>
<p>Brattle concludes his account with what Perry Miller regards as "one of the greatest
			sentences of the time, which, eschewing the jargon of the covenant, reveals how much the
			theme of the jeremiads had become, if only through the discipline of disillusion, a
			secular patriotism." Brattle states, "I am afraid that ages will not wear off that
			reproach and those stains which these things leave behind them upon our land." The focus
			here on the effects the episode will have on "our land" was significant for a Puritan
			world accustomed to viewing itself as the domain of God.</p>
<p>Thomas Brattle's Letter pried opened a chink in the armor of the Puritan jeremiad and the
			logic of the covenant by the use of reason to combat hysteria. Miller writes that "[b]y
			strictly and conscientiously applying the doctrine of the jeremiad, the court created a
			situation in which meretricious confession went free and sincere denial automatically
			became guilt." Whereas the Puritan covenant with God placed high value upon confession
			and repentance as a cure for social ills, these became evasive maneuvers which "did not
			heal the grievance, but compounded the evil."</p>
<p>While Thomas Brattle's vision Letter of October 8, 1692 did not contribute to ending the
			Salem witchcraft hysteria, it provides a brilliant example of a growing sentiment in
			late-17th Century New England that the strictures of the jeremiad and framework of the
			covenant may not be the omnipotent force which many a Puritan minister admonished his
			flock from the pulpits of Boston. The Letter shows, instead, how the extreme events that
			occurred in Salem revealed clearly to some the extremism and danger inherent in the
			reigning theology of the day.</p>

<h3>Francis Dane</h3>
<p>Francis Dane was born about 1615 in England and died on February 
  16, 1607 at the age of eighty-one in Andover, Massachusetts. Dane was the elderly 
  senior pastor of Andover and a highly respected leader of the community. In 
  1682, the congregation hired a young Harvard graduate Rev. Thomas Bernard to 
  aid Rev. Dane with his ministerial duties in his old age. There was tension 
  between the two about their salaries, and the two ministers reacted very differently 
  to the witch trials of 1692. Initially, Bernard did much to aid the accusations 
  of witchcraft in Andover, while Dane had more of his family members accused 
  than any other family in 1692. Furthermore, it was Dane's early October petitions 
  to the General Court for pardons, writing against spectral evidence, filing 
  of slander suits, and bold stance against the witchcraft trials that are credited 
  with ending the proceedings in Andover so quickly. Dane is still regarded as 
  the hero of Andover during the Witch Trials of 1692. </p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001 </p>
<p>Rev. Francis Dane was born around 1615 in England and died on February 16, 1697 at the
			age of eighty-one in Andover, Massachusetts. He is the son of John Dane, who settled in
			both Ipswich and Roxbury. Dane's name is found among the early residents of Ipswich in
			1641, and according to Joseph Felt's History of Ipswich, Dane moved to Andover in 1648.
			Dane became the second pastor of the North Parish in 1649. He remained in this position
			for forty-eight years until his death in 1697. In regard to his education, Rev. Cotton
			Mather lists Dane as one of the young men who finished his studies in the Colony before
			Harvard College conferred degrees. In addition to his ministry, Dane founded school for
			Andover youth. Dane had two sons, Nathaniel and Francis, and four daughters, Elizabeth
			(Johnson), Hannah (Goodhue), Phebe (Robinson), and Abigail (Faulkner). He himself was
			married three times: Elizabeth Ingals (pre 1645-1676), Mary Thomas (1677-1689), and
			Hannah Abbot (1690-his death 1697).</p>
<p>Abiel Abbot's History of Andover notes that there is no record of any discord between
			Dane and his congregation from 1649 to 1680, although historian Sarah L. Bailey calls
			the reality of such a situation into question in her Historical Sketches of Andover.
			Whether flawless or not, it is evident that Dane was a highly respected and powerful
			member of the Andover community, comparable only to Dudley Bradstreet, former Governor
			of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Around 1680, church members began to complain about the
			capabilities of Dane and requested a younger, more vibrant minister for their church. In
			January of 1682, the congregation called the young Rev. Thomas Barnard, a recent
			graduate of Harvard and protege of Cotton Mather. Soon thereafter, the congregation
			stopped paying Dane's salary and gave Barnard a full salary. Dane petitioned the General
			Court in Boston, and the Andover church was required to pay Dane thirty pounds a year to
			share pastoral duties with Barnard. The church decided to pay Barnard fifty pounds a
			year, which much less than Barnard expected, with the stipulation that when Dane retired
			or died, Barnard would receive the full eighty pounds annual salary.</p>
<p>Andover church politics were fairly stagnate for the next ten years, although it appears
			that the tension between Dane and Barnard was evident throughout this time. In 1692,
			however, things started to heat up when the witch hunt broke out in near by Salem
			Village. By August, the hunt had stretched to Andover with an invitation to two of the
			Salem accusers to come and find witches in Andover. Rev. Barnard did much to facilitate
			the witch hunt, holding prayer meetings in the church that resulted in "touch tests"
			where the accusers could simply touch community members who were then accused of
			witchery. Rev. Dane refused to take part in the witch hunt from the outset, and perhaps
			because of this as well as the tension between Dane, Bradstreet, and Barnard, more
			members of Dane's family were accused than any other single family in the entire
			episode. In addition to Dane's extended family, two of Dane's daughters, his daughter in
			law, and five of his grandchildren were accused.</p>
<p>Upham writes, "The Rev. Francis Dane deserves to be recognized preeminent and for a time
			almost alone in bold denunciation and courageous resistance of the expiable proceedings
			of that dark day." Dane was the driving force behind ending the trials in Andover. He
			first arranged for the Andover children to be let out of jail on bond in October 1692.
			Husbands, brothers, and fathers of the accused witches then joined Dane in petitioning
			the General Court for the release of the Andover women on the grounds that they were
			needed at home and with the coming of winter would not fare well in the prisons. On
			October 18, 1692, Dane wrote a petition addressing what he believed to be the forced and
			false confessions of guilt made by women during the frenzy of the "touch test," in order
			to save themselves from trial and possible execution. Dane writes that there was,
			"reason to think that the extreme urgency that was used with some of them by their
			friends and others who privately examined them, and the fear they were then under, hath
			been an inducement to them to admit such things." This was the first attempt to explain
			the confessions of those who had been accused. Dane also wrote letters to the courts and
			his fellow ministers condemning spectral evidence using such strong language as, "I
			believe the reports have been scandalous and unjust, neither will bear y light." Slander
			charges filed by Dane and members of his family, particularly Abigail Dane Faulkner, did
			much to deter a resurgence of accusations in Andover as well.</p>
<p>Local historian Enders Robinson in his book Salem Witchcraft concluded from the above
			facts that the Andover incident was a direct conspiracy of Barnard against Dane.
			Although this theory cannot be proven, and Dane was responsible for halting the Andover
			proceedings, Robinson makes an unfounded assumption. Barnard was highly respected and
			had studied with Cotton Mather at Harvard. Mather was one of the top proponents of the
			trials and the necessity of purging the colony of witches. Barnard was not the only
			minister at the time to be lured to Mather's convincing theological arguments. In
			Barnard's mind, promoting the witch trials could very well have been the best thing he
			could do for his congregation. One must also note that as Dane's resistance movement
			gained momentum, Barnard sided with Dane over the courts. Robinson believes this to be
			indicative of Barnard's manipulative nature. Although this is possible, there is no
			evidence for Barnard's motive in changing sides on the witchcraft issue. Regardless of
			the social motives behind what occurred in Andover in 1692, Dane immerged as a fearless
			and effective leader. He suffered under the accusations of numerous members of his
			family, yet found the strength to guide an entire community through an irrationality
			that could have lead to many more innocent deaths had he not taken such an outspoken,
			controversial, and admirable stand.</p>

<h3>Cotton Mather</h3>
<p>Cotton Mather, one of the most famous (and infamous) figures 
    in the history of Puritan New England, was a complex man of great influence 
    upon American history and the discourse that accompanied the Salem witch trials 
    in the years following 1692. As a prominent Bostonian minister, author, and 
    born on Feb. 12th 1663 as the son of the Harvard president Increase Mather, 
    Cotton's reputation as a stalwart believer in the direct influence of the 
    devil upon the physical world through the spiritual realm was already in place 
    by the start of the witch trials. Consulted by three of the five judges, and 
    friends with all of the major authorities involved, Cotton's self-contradicting 
    positions on the use of spectral evidence and the prosecution of the Salem 
    witches heavily swayed the directions of the trial proceedings and the executions. 
    Cotton was also appointed as the somewhat reluctant first historian of the 
    trials, through the commissioning of his book, The Wonders of the Invisible 
    World, that served to justify the trials to the higher powers in the Massachusetts 
    Bay Colony. It was for this book that Cotton found himself spit upon in the 
    streets (and some annals of history) to the day of his death on Feb. 13th 
    1728. </p>

<h3>
			Cotton Mather 
		</h3>
<p>Written By Rachel Walker</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Born on Feb. 12th 1663 into a family of renown New England Puritan ministers, including
			Rev. John Cotton and Rev. Richard Mather, Cotton Mather seemed destined to achieve fame.
			His own father, Rev. Increase Mather, also held a position of prominence as a
			well-admired political leader, minister of the South Church in Boston, as well as the
			presidency of Harvard College. Excelling in his entrance exams in Latin and Greek, young
			Cotton began his schooling at Harvard at only 12 years of age. After receiving his M.A.
			at age 18, he felt called to a life of service in the clergy. A terrible stutter,
			however, forced him to delay entering the ministry and the demands of preaching, and
			instead he entertained the notion of becoming a doctor. Encouragement from a friend
			eventually pulled him over this speech impediment and back to his calling, although
			medicine remained a key interest throughout his life. Mather preached his first sermon
			in August of 1680, and went on to be ordained by 1685 at age 22. Besides his involvement
			with the witch trials in Salem during the 1690s, Cotton Mather is remembered as one of
			the most influential Puritan ministers of his day. Never achieving his father's success
			as a political leader or president of Harvard, Cotton made his mark through his efforts
			as a master of the pen. By the end of his life, he had published over 400 of his works,
			ranging from the subject of witchcraft to smallpox inoculation. His publication, Curiosa
			Americana(1712-24), demonstrated his abilities as an accomplished scientist, and earned
			him election to the prestigious Royal Society of London, England. Although his efforts
			of encouragement in smallpox inoculation were met with much resistance and nearly killed
			his own son, he is recognized as having been a progressive medical advocate for his
			day.</p>
<p>In regard to the Salem witch trials, however, it was Mather's interest in the craft and
			actions of Satan that won him an audience with the most powerful figures involved in the
			trial proceedings, several of the judges and the local ministers in Salem. Before the
			outbreak of accusations in Salem Village, Mather had already published his account,
			Remarkable Providences (1684), describing in detail he possession of the children of the
			Goodwin family of Boston. Mather actually took the eldest of the children, 13-year-old
			Martha, into his home to make a more intense study of the phenomenon. Later scholars
			have suggested that this book in fact outlined the symptoms of clinical hysteria. It was
			this same hysteria that provided the behavioral model for the circle of "afflicted"
			girls during the trials in Salem. Mather, however, used his experience with Goodwins to
			further his notion that New England was in fact a battleground with Satan. Similar
			themes appear in his sermons and in the Preface to one of his children's books, in which
			he warns young readers: "They which lie, must go to their father, the devil, into
			everlasting burning; they which never pray, God will pour out his wrath upon them; and
			when they bed and pray in hell fire, God will not forgive them, but there [they] must
			lie forever. Are you willing to go to hell and burn with the devil and his angels?".
			Thus, the subject of eternal damnation weighed constantly upon Mather's mind, and it
			resonates in his own diary accounts. Scholars suggest that Mather's dramatic
			descriptions the devil's activity upon the young Goodwin children may have led to the
			first cry of witchcraft among the young girls in Salem Village.</p>
<p>Although Mather was not directly involved in the proceedings of the Salem witch trials,
			he wrote a letter to one of the magistrates in the trials, John Richards of Boston,
			urging caution in the use of spectral evidence. Mather was also the author of the
			"Return of the Several Ministers," a report sent to the judges of the Salem court. This
			carefully-worded document advised caution in the use of spectral evidence, saying that
			the devil could indeed assume the shape of an innocent person, and decrying the use of
			spectral evidence in the trials, their "noise, company, and openness", and the
			utilization of witch tests such as the recitation of the Lord's Prayer. However, the
			final paragraph of the document appears to undercut this cautionary statement in
			recommending "the detection of witchcrafts". Thus, in Bernard Rosenthal and Perry
			Miller's opinions, the courts interpreted the letter as Mather's seal of approval for
			the trials to go on.</p>
<p>Accounts of eye-witnesses and historians paint a more contradictory portrait of Mather's
			hand in the trials. Mather is haunted in history by the account given in Robert Calef's
			book More Wonders of the Invisible World (1700) of his conduct at the hanging of former
			Salem minister George Burroughs. Calef reported that Burroughs recited a perfect
			rendition of the Lord's Prayer while on the gallows, something Mather himself thought
			impossible for anyone guilty of an alliance with the devil. The crowd was so moved that
			some wanted to prevent the execution. Mather, mounted on his horse, proclaimed that
			Burroughs was no ordained minister, and that the "Devil has often been transformed into
			an Angel of Light." With those words, under the tearful gaze of an ambivalent crowd the
			George Burroughs was hanged.</p>
<p>Perhaps Cotton's most self-damning act within the public eye was his publication of the
			volume The Wonders of the Invisible World, in October, 1692, after the final executions.
			Although Cotton's words describe, and to some degree justify the trials and deaths in
			Salem that year, the book is anything but resolved with regards to Mather's true
			feelings about the trials. Although Cotton insists the book is not written in an evil
			spirit or with any prejudice, he writes of the trials of accused witches such as Bridget
			Bishop saying there was "little occasion to prove witchcraft, it being evident and
			notorious to all beholders". He describes Susanna Martin as, "one of the most impudent,
			scurrilous, wicked creatures in the world". And worst of all, he condones the use of the
			spectral evidence to convict the witches of his five cases outlined! In his own letter
			to William Stoughton, penned during the trial of George Burroughs, Cotton also asserts
			the guilt of this man, stating he is the ringleader of 10 other witches, a confession
			received from five Andover witches that "refreshes his soul".</p>
<p>Careful analysis of the document, as well as Mather's own diaries, reveals that he may
			not have been quite as convinced of the righteousness of the trials as he describes in
			his book. A cautious foreword to the manuscript reads, "I live by Neighbours that force
			me to produce these undeserved lines". Perry Miller describes the whole work as "utter
			confusion". Robert Calef, author of More Wonders of the Invisible World, published a
			very different account than Mather's that put Cotton on the defensive for the rest of
			his life. Mather cried libel and threatened to sue, but the issue was never resolved and
			Cotton was forced to bite his tongue and bear what would become a flood of contemporary
			scorn for his witch-hunting labors. Near the end of his life, his diary records a hint
			of regret for the thanklessness of the groups he had spurned in his work. He is baffled
			by why "everybody points at me, and speaks of me as by far the most afflicted minister
			in all New England". Perry Miller describes Cotton's later years as a time of intense
			regret and remorse about the trials. He points out that Cotton's diary paints a picture
			of a man "panicky lest the Lord take revenge upon his family 'for [Mather's] not
			appearing with Vigor enough to stop the proceedings of the Judges'". Clearly Cotton
			could not see his outside of his own world of expectations, reputations, and
			contradictions. He died on Feb. 13th 1728 at age 66, survived by only one of his three
			wives and two of his fifteen children.</p>

<h3>Increase Mather</h3>
<p>INCREASE MATHER (1639-1723): Mather, an influential Boston minister 
    and father of Cotton Mather, is credited with being a force for moderation 
    throughout the Salem witchcraft trials and helping bring them to an end with 
    the circulation of his Cases of Conscience on October 3, 1692. Increase Mather 
    has drawn fire from some historians of the period for his hesitancy to take 
    a firm stand against the trials and executions early in the summer of 1692. 
    However, Mather's unique role as leading minister, President of Harvard College, 
    and confidant of Governor William Phips placed him in the precarious position 
    of contesting the witchcraft trials while supporting the judges. While his 
    actions in 1692 were often self-contradictory, he was, according to Kenneth 
    Murdock regarded as "an ally and leader of those whom we see as the most liberal 
    of his time." </p>

			Increase Mather
		</h3>
<p>Written By Mathew Madden</p>

<p>John van der Spriett, 1688. Source: Massachusetts Historical Society.</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Increase Mather was born on June 21, 1639 to Richard and Katherine Mather. He and four of
			his five brothers would follow Richard's call to guide the morality and spirituality of
			their fellow man, even as the family ventured with other Puritans to New England in the
			seventeenth century. There the Mathers settled, as Richard took up his ministry in
			Dorchester just south of Boston.</p>
<p>Increase graduated from Harvard College in 1656, an institution to which he would return
			as its President. His son, Cotton Mather was born into the third generation of Puritan
			Mather ministers, and after following in father's footsteps by studying at Harvard,
			Cotton would join his father as a leader in the Boston religious establishment.</p>
<p>In February 1674, Increase Mather delivered a sermon, entitled "The Day of Trouble is
			Near", the first of many great speeches to the faithful that would make him an
			influential Puritan leader in Boston and across the growing Massachusetts Bay Colony. By
			1680-1681, Increase Mather had "established himself as the conservative champion of the
			New England church." His predominant role in Puritan society would call him across the
			ocean, as turbulent events in England led to the revocation of the Massachusetts Bay
			Colony's charter. Between 1688 and 1692, Increase Mather was in England advocating on
			behalf of the colony.</p>
<p>Mather returned to New England on May 14, 1692 with not simply a new charter, but also a
			new Governor, Sir William Phips. Increase Mather played a crucial role in securing
			Phips' appointment by the Crown, and therefore the Governor was indebted to him for his
			position.</p>
<p>When Mather and Phips arrived in Boston, events in Salem Village had already begun to
			swirl beyond the confines of that small community. The jails were beginning to fill with
			the accused witches, and interim Governor Bradstreet had kept courts from sitting in
			trial. The new Governor, empowered by a new charter, looked to clear the judicial
			backlog and established the special Court of Oyer and Terminer to "hear and determine"
			the witchcraft cases. On May 27, 1692 the Court was established, and Bridget Bishop was
			the first to be executed on Gallows Hill in Salem exactly two weeks later on June
			10.</p>
<p>Governor Phips, apparently surprised at the speed and force which his actions had begun
			to unleash, looked to Increase Mather and other notable Boston ministers for guidance.
			Increase signed onto "The Return of Several Ministers," written by his son, Cotton
			Mather, which put the Boston ministers on record urging caution in the use of spectral
			evidence in the Salem court. Pre-occupied with preparations for an expedition to fight
			Indian forces in Maine, Phips did not pay sufficient attention to the mounting number of
			arrests and executions ordered by the Salem court, before he left Boston for Maine in
			mid-August 1692. With Phips went Increase Mather's highest patron in civil government
			and any hopes he might have had of restraining the court in Salem.</p>
<p>As June stretched into July, the pace of arrests, examinations, and imprisonments only
			quickened leading to the execution of five women on July 19. On July 31, Increase
			delivered a sermon at Simon Willard's Third Church in Boston in which he posed the
			question to the congregation: "O what makes the difference between the devils in hell
			and the angels of heaven?" Mather answered that the quality of holiness distinguished an
			angel in heaven from the devils below, and in doing so he "focused responsibility on the
			people of New England at large, and yet looked to individuals for the means to solve the
			problem. It encouraged the individual believer to attend to the state of his or her own
			soul regardless of what might be happening in the world." (Peterson, 93). The impact of
			such words from a Boston pulpit on views of the witchcraft problem is indirect, but
			clear nonetheless. Mather advised the congregation that they should focus their
			attention on their own shortcomings and not those that they saw in their neighbors and
			friends. Still, this was not a clear message to halt the trials, and they continued
			unabated in Salem.</p>
<p>Increase Mather attended only one trial in Salem, that of George Burroughs, Jr., and he
			seems to have fully agreed with the result. Bernard Rosenthal in his Salem Story focuses
			attention on the seeming contradiction between Increase Mather's overall opposition to
			the Court's methods and his support for the same methods in the case of Mr. Burroughs.
			Rosenthal writes that, "Burroughs, as a dissenting minister, offered so powerful a
			symbol of lost Puritan power that such moderate and influential ministers as Increase
			and Cotton Mather lost their way in confronting his case." Contradictions such as this
			continue to haunt comments on Mather by scholars of the period.</p>
<p>By late September 1692, the witchcraft trials had truly reached an hysterical pitch.
			Nineteen had been hanged, and Giles Cory had been tortured to death for refusing to
			enter a plea. Scores of people languished in the jails awaiting trial on the charges
			against them.</p>
<p>In Cases of Conscience Increase Mather forcefully related his distrust of spectral
			evidence to convict witches. He argued that it would be better that ten witches go free
			than the blood of a single innocent be shed. One Mather biographer wrote that, "No zeal
			to stamp out crimes ever drove him from his belief that, whatever the fate of the
			guilty, the innocent must never be in peril." His strong words of disapproval for
			spectral evidence so prominently used by the Court of Oyer and Terminer ended the trials
			after the directive from Governor Phips at the end of October, recently returned from
			his expedition in Maine.</p>
<p>Cases of Conscience, however, is not without its flaws, the chief one being Mather's
			attempt to absolve the judges of Salem of any wrongdoing and to praise them for their
			work. Bernard Rosenthal writes that, "Indeed, when the witch trials ended, he damned the
			prosecution and justified the prosecutors." Perry Miller, more forcefully, writes that
			"Without the postscript, Cases of Conscience would be a bold stroke; with it, the book
			is a miserable species of double-talk." Kenneth Murdock offers a more balanced approach
			when he writes of Mather's postscript, "Less could hardly be said in fairness. More
			approval of the trials Mather never expressed."</p>
<p>Increase Mather has been criticized for his delay in putting his considerable moral
			authority against the trials, but it would seem that from his endorsement of "The Return
			of the Ministers" through his own Cases of Conscience, Mather was continually seeking to
			lend caution to the hysteria without undermining the tenuous framework of the Puritan
			government in Boston and Salem. Others have criticized Mather for his seeming duplicity,
			in excoriating the trials in general but supporting that of Burroughs or in deriding the
			conduct of the Court but praising its overseers. It is important to note, as many have
			done, that Increase Mather very much believed in the evils and dangers of witchcraft and
			had no doubt that if the handiwork of the devil was proven, a Puritan society should
			"suffer no witch to live." Mather may very well have thought George Burroughs was a
			witch and been satisfied to hear of his hanging in August 1692. He likely admired to
			some degree the tenacity with which the Court of Oyer and Terminer took to the task of
			defending the covenanted community of the Massachusetts Bay from the devil.</p>
<p>Increase Mather, however, understood that innocent blood was being shed, and that the
			Salem court ran rampant without concern for the advice of the clerical guides, an
			unprecedented development in the Puritan Colony. In the witchcraft trials that grew out
			of the supposed afflictions of young girls in Salem Village, Mather may also have seen
			the symptoms of a fundamentally changing Puritan world. He was caught in the middle of
			it, along with the rest of New England, and no doubt agreed with his friend Thomas
			Brattle that, "ages will not wear off that reproach and those stains which these things
			will leave behind them upon our land."</p>

<h3>Samuel Parris</h3>
<p>One of the most notorious personalities in Salem, the Rev. Samuel Parris represents
to some the danger of religious power when wielded by self-centered and deceptive 
individuals. To others, his antipathy towards his opponents
in Salem Village was simply a small factor in the larger picture of the
Salem witch trials.  In either case, the persecution of "witches" began
in his household, and through that point extended deeply into the
American psyche.  One cannot help but question the amount of
responsibility that Parris, who began preaching about the work of the
Devil in his parish holds for the events of 1692.</p>

<h3>
			Rev. Samuel Parris
		</h3>
<p>Written by Seth Ragosta, 2002</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Fall Semester 2002</p>
<p>Born in 1653 as the younger son of a London cloth merchant, Samuel Parris began his life
			in the shadow of others. By his father's death in 1673 when Samuel was twenty years old,
			it was clear that he would need to leave England for any chance at financial
			independence and success. Failing at business in a Caribbean sugar plantation and later
			in business activities in Boston, Parris eventually decided to join the ministry and
			look for an appropriate parish in New England. His search culminated at the little
			village of Salem where the local elders offered the ministry church. </p>
<p>The position was ideally what Parris needed, but he was aware the past conflicts over the
			village minister and took nearly a year to make his decision. As he knew, the village
			had gone through three other ministers in relatively quick succession, and no one before
			Parris had been deemed worthy to be ordained. During this year of negotiations Parris
			wrangled for his salary and benefits, in the process creating an exceptional amount of
			animosity towards him within certain village factions. By demanding more pay and
			benefits such as ownership of the village minister's house, free firewood, and bonuses
			for any outsiders preached to on Sundays, Parris indicated an important trait in his
			personality. He saw his position as something demanding and deserving respect above all
			else. In Parris' mind, by not deferring to his needs and desires those who opposed him
			marked themselves as people against traditional reverent attitudes towards the church.
			This may have contributed to his support and to the torrent of witchcraft accusations
			throughout 1692. He did not trust those who did not follow the world order as he saw it,
			and was fearful of the influence of outsiders on the village itself. </p>
<p>Parris' preaching had a major hand in creating the divisions within the village that
			contributed to the accusations of 1692. During the crisis, he declared the church under
			siege by the Devil, who was assisted by "Wicked &amp; Reprobate men." This was during
			the last sermon his daughter Betty and niece Abigail heard before they became
			"afflicted." As Mary Beth Norton puts it in In the Devil's Snare, almost undoubtedly
			those "wicked" men were among Parris' detractors and opposition within the community.
			Parris believed in his moral superiority and was determined to draw battle lines. Even
			as early as November of 1691, the minister called on churchgoers to "Sit thou at my
			right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool." He intended to have his supporters
			and the church unified against anyone that would dare speak against him.</p>
<p> As some historians believe, Parris and other adults around him may have had a major hand
			in "picking" some of the accused. Through either direct order or indirect insinuation,
			Parris may have chosen not only those who represented an unusual or disliked position in
			the village, but also those who had supported his enemies and critics. </p>
<p>Parris himself had a major part in the actual trials, serving as a witness who submitted
			legal complaints about the girls' sufferings. Along with other prominent men, Parris
			testified about the attacks of Rebecca Nurse against Ann Putnam Sr., Jr., Mary Walcot
			and Abigail Williams. He declared that at the trial when Nurse's hands were freed, "some
			of the afflicted were pinched and upon the motion of [Nurse's] head and fingers some of
			[the girls] were tortured and farther that some of the afflicted then and there affirmed
			that they saw a black man whispering into [Nurse's] ear." As questionable as the girls
			claims may have been to any observer, the support and testimony of such an influential
			and educated man could not have done anything but strengthen their claims. Unlike the
			ministers in nearby Ipswich, Rowley, and Beverly, who stepped forward to defend some of
			the accused, Parris was clearly filled with "credulity and pitiless zeal," as Marion
			Starkey aptly puts it. </p>
<p>While Parris' actions, or lack thereof, certainly demonstrate a rather reprehensible
			character, it would be a mistake to assume that contemporaries believed the same.
			Indeed, in 1695, two years after the end of the trials, Parris still garnered a majority
			of town support. This demonstrates not only the ambiguity of the trials in late 17th
			century imaginations, but also the influence that Parris held within the community.
			While much of the village did support him to a certain degree, it should also be noted
			that Rebecca Nurse's family and others directly accused the minister of providing names
			to the court, and many people had strong misgivings about his place in the trials. By
			1696 village sentiment and growing irritation finally forced Parris out of town in favor
			of Reverend Green, a man who genuinely wanted to heal Salem and started the village on
			the long and uncertain road to recovery. </p>
<p>While the trials eventually extended well outside Parris' control and ability to predict,
			he undoubtedly holds a position of importance regarding their genesis. Historians Boyer
			and Nissenbaum in their well-known history, Salem Possessed, define Parris as a
			"reference point" from which to view the trials and their beginning. He was seen in the
			village as a dividing line between two groups, in his mind the believers and true
			Christians of his small congregation versus the suspicious and dangerous people who
			would not join it. He represented the hatred in the village that enabled people to
			attack each other so horribly. By naming specific individuals and pushing certain
			accusations, Parris earns responsibility as one of the most tarnished characters in the
			history of Salem's story. As Miller represented him in The Crucible, the Rev. Samuel
			Parris was the embodiment of self-serving and small-minded reactionary behavior. If we
			are not careful to guard against those like him, our freedom and the sanity of society
			are in jeopardy.</p>

<h3>Samuel Willard</h3>
<p>Samuel Willard played an important role in the halting of the Salem witch trials. 
Born in 1640 to a privileged family, Willard had a long simmering devotion to 
the Puritan church, a devotion he would later cultivate at Harvard College. Despite 
his religious fervor, Willard appears to be man of uncommon calm, as he urged 
caution in the accusing and trying of witches. Willard also denounced spectral 
evidence, claiming that the devil could impersonate even the innocent by appearing 
in their shape. After the trials ended, Willard was to push hard for reconciliation 
between the pro-Parris and anti-Parris factions of Salem Village.

<h3>
			Samuel Willard
		</h3>
<p>Written By Dave Hendrick</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>In evaluating those Puritan ministers involved in the Salem witch trials, we would
			certainly have to regard the Rev. Samuel Willard of Boston as one of the virtuous
			clergymen, as he was opposed to the trials and tried to influence public opinion against
			them in 1692. Undoubtedly, great things had long been expected of Willard, as his family
			lineage bespeaks that of a man destined to make an impact upon the community.</p>
<p>Willard was born in the town Concord, Massachusetts Bay in 1640. His place among the
			town's leaders was virtually assured from birth, as his father, Simon Willard, was the
			founder of Concord. Willard soon set out on the familiar course for young aspiring
			ministers, enrolling at Harvard where he would study long enough to receive his Master's
			Degree in 1659. Indeed, Samuel Willard could very well be remembered solely for his
			fiery devotion to the Puritan church, as he was well known for his vicious denunciations
			of any attempts to water down the Puritan tenets of predestination, irresistible grace,
			total depravity, and perseverance of the saints. Willard was also known for his staunch
			support for the continued marriage between church and state, and held strong opposition
			to the creeping Quaker and Baptist influences in the community. In these ways, Willard's
			sermons were heavily influential to men who would take up the Puritan cause after his
			death, Jonathan Edwards in particular. Nevertheless, it is Willard's role in the witch
			trials that concerns us here.</p>
<p>Willard's past experience seems to make him a fine candidate to speak out about the
			trials of the 1690s, as he played a crucial role in heading off a potential outbreak of
			hysteria some twenty years prior to the Salem episode. In 1671, while ministering in the
			frontier town of Groton, Massachusetts Bay, Willard was witness to a number of strange
			acts that befell one of his servants, a young girl of sixteen by the name of Elizabeth
			Knapp. Knapp seems to have exhibited a number of the symptoms that would be made famous
			by the "afflicted" girls of Salem village twenty years later. Indeed, Knapp was observed
			to act in a "strange and unwonten" manner, and often fell into violent fits and
			complained of being attacked. When Knapp eventually accused the specter of a neighbor of
			attacking her, Willard insisted she put an end to such accusations at once, for the
			neighbor was a person of "sincere uprightness before God." Also, Willard seems to have
			exercised good judgment in being hesitant to believe that the devil afflicted the girl,
			writing that "Whither shee has covenanted with the Devill or noe, I think this is a case
			unanswerable, her declarations have been soe contradictorye. . . . ". Although Willard
			was yet to denounce the idea of Satan using a person's image or specter to attack
			another person, here he seems to have used impeccable judgment in not rushing to
			conclusions about why his young woman appeared afflicted.</p>
<p>Willard's role in Salem also presents a man concerned that innocent people must be
			protected from the misinformed and vicious elements in the Puritan society. When
			Governor William Phips sought guidance from some of the learned clergy in the area,
			Willard was one of the several who signed "The Return of Several Ministers." This
			document acknowledged that while the devil might be responsible for the afflictions
			found in Salem, it urged the court to exercise great caution to prevent the innocent
			from being convicted. The ministers further discounted the reliability of spectral
			evidence by asserting that the devil could impersonate the likeness of any person, even
			an "innocent" without that person's permission. Although the court in Salem ignored this
			caution, spectral evidence was eventually called into question the trials lost their
			theological foundation. The work of Willard and his like minded colleagues also shows
			that to whatever extent clergymen in Salem may have contributed to the witchcraft
			outbreak, Willard and other Boston ministers tried to quell its spread.</p>
<p>A level-headed moderate concerning witchcraft, Willard is thought to have written a
			sixteen page fictional dialogue between two ministers who hold opposed points of view on
			the Salem trials. One minister represented the views of the Salem clergy, the other
			represented the Boston ministers. The dialogue, entitled "Some Miscellany Observations
			on our present debates respecting Witchcrafts: A Dialogue between 'S' and 'B'" is
			clearly the work of one who saw great injustice in the theological and legal aspects of
			the trials. Among Willard's chief complaints is the fact that so often a confession
			coupled with further accusations resulted in an acquittal, while a denial of guilt
			virtually guaranteed one's conviction. Among the Boston minister's key arguments in the
			dialogue is that "witches" who ultimately confess and accuse other witches are not to be
			trusted, because, after all, they're witches! When the Salem clergyman decries using too
			much caution, allowing many witches to go free, Boston replies that "the more horrid the
			crime is, the more cautious we ought to be in making any guilty of it." Boston's point
			being that relying on the suspect spectral evidence was no basis from which to ruin men
			and women's lives and cast a permanent stigma upon their family name.</p>
<p>Samuel Willard continued to be a tireless anti-trial activist well after the trials had
			passed. In 1694, he pushed for a reconciliation between the pro and anti-Samuel Parris
			factions within Salem village. Willard was also known to ask, in public ceremony and
			sermon, for God to forgive the atrocities that had taken place in Salem at the hands of
			overzealous townsfolk.</p>

<h3>
			Sarah Churchill (or Churchwell)
		</h3>
<p>Written by Sara Weaver, 2002</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Fall Semester 2002</p>
<p>Sarah Churchill spent her early childhood in Saco, Maine. Her parents were Arthur and
			Eleanor Churchill and her grandfather was a well-respected and wealthy man named Major
			William Phillips. In 1680, when Sarah was eight years old, Wabanaki Indians attacked
			Saco. During the attack, Sarah and her parents joined 50 other people in the home of her
			grandfather. When the Wabanaki's arrived in Saco, they surrounded the house and
			attempted to burn the settlers out of the garrison. The attempt failed, but they shot
			and injured several members of the party - including Major Phillips. The attack scared
			the Churchill family into moving to Marblehead, Massachusetts. While the fate of Sarah's
			mother, Eleanor, is unknown, her father Arthur lived until 1710. By 1692 Sarah had moved
			to Salem Village closer to her relatives, the Ingersolls. According to Mary Beth Norton,
			author of In the Devil's Snare, Sarah, like several other girls who witnessed the
			terrors of the Indian Wars, may have suffered from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. </p>
<p>In Salem, Sarah became the maidservant of George Jacobs Sr., who was a crippled old man
			living on his prosperous farm near Salem Village. By hiring herself out as a servant,
			Sarah went from being the granddaughter of one of the wealthiest and socially prominent
			men in Maine (Major Phillips) to a low status maidservant for a country farmer in Salem. </p>
<p>When the witchcraft crisis broke out in Salem Village, Sarah was 25 years old, and she is
			usually regarded as one of the circle of "afflicted girls". But, as Norton has pointed
			out, there were three different age groups of afflicted female accusers -- little girls,
			thirteen years-old and younger; older young people in their late teens and twenties; and
			married women in their thirties and older. Sarah was related to the 18-year-old Mary
			Walcott, the cousin of Ann Putnam, Jr., and thereby in a position to become acquainted
			with the other young accusers in the village. When Sarah's symptoms of affliction
			declined, and the other afflicted girls accused her of signing the Devil's book to avoid
			torture. In response to the accusations, Sarah confessed that her master George Jacobs
			Sr. and his granddaughter, Margaret Jacobs, forced her to sign the Devil's book. Sarah's
			confession sparked a chain of testimonies against George Jacobs Sr. The day following
			Sarah's confession, Mercy Lewis accused George Jacobs Sr. of interactions with the
			Devil. Abigail Williams, also accused Jacobs of recruiting six people to join the ranks
			of the witches - Sarah Churchill, Margaret Jacobs and her parents, as well as Phillip
			and Mary English. </p>
<p>During George Jacobs Sr.'s interrogation Sarah Churchill was eager to testify that he did
			not conduct family prayers and that he had led a "wicked life". As Sarah was probably a
			victim of Jacobs' physical abuse, she was quick to implicate her master. It was said
			that the 80 year old, Jacobs Sr. beat Sarah with his canes when she did not do her
			household chores to his satisfaction. Jacobs, who at the incredulous at the accusations
			against him, denigrated his young accusers in court, calling them "witch bitches."
			Though Churchill and justices of the Court of Oyer and Terminer pushed Jacobs to
			confess, he never gave in to the accusations against him. </p>
<p>The day following Jacob Sr.'s interrogation, His granddaughter Margaret Jacobs confessed
			to being a witch and implicated her grandfather and George Burroughs. Margaret and Sarah
			Churchill had realized that confessors lived and those who denied witchcraft accusations
			against them were hanged. The Court of Oyer and Terminer was intent on extracting
			confessions from the accused so that the confessed could reveal other witches in the
			community. By May 11th, Sarah Churchill, Margaret Jacobs, and George Jacobs Sr. were in
			custody of Salem Village officials. </p>
<p>On June 1, 1692, Sarah Churchill made a second confession to acts of witchcraft to save
			herself. During this second confession, she accused George Jacobs Sr., Ann Pudeator and
			Bridget Bishop of being witches and then claimed she used "images" brought by Ann
			Pudeator to torture Mercy Lewis, Ann Putnam Jr. and Betty Hubbard. Sarah later retracted
			this second confession claiming that Salem justices threatened to throw her into the
			"dongin" with "Mr. Borows" if she did not confess. Sarah Churchill was one of only two
			girls to admit that she lied to save herself (the other was Mary Warren). Sarah is
			quoted, "If I told Mr. Noyes but once I had set my hand on the Book he would believe me,
			but if I told the truth and said I had not set my hand to the Book a hundred times he
			would not believe me." </p>
<p>Sarah's confession saved her from hanging in Salem. In the aftermath of the Salem
			witchcraft crisis Sarah Churchill married a weaver, Edward Andrews, in 1709 in Maine
			after being fined for premarital fornication. The last record of Sarah Churchill is
			dated 1731. In comparison to the detailed treatment she receives in Norton's book, Boyer
			and Nissembaum in their book, Salem Possessed, only mention Sarah Churchill in reference
			to their famous map of Salem that claims the witchcraft crisis was an economically based
			conflict. Sarah Churchill is named as one of the "afflicted girls" that Boyer and
			Nissembaum fail to list on the map because they "think it a mistake to treat the girls
			themselves as decisive shapers of the witchcraft outbreak as it evolved."</p>

<h3>
			Elizabeth Hubbard
		</h3>
<p>Written By Amy Nichols</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hubbard was one of the original girls to begin the witchcraft accusations, and
			she continued to be a leading accuser throughout the summer and fall of 1692. Although
			little is known about Elizabeth, her name has stood out through history due to her
			violent fits under the affliction of the "witches" and her active role as an
			accuser.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, like most of the other afflicted girls, was detached from her parents and
			family of birth. She went to Salem to live with her great-aunt Rachel Hubbard Griggs and
			her husband, the town physician Dr. William Griggs who diagnosed the original girls as
			being under the affliction of an "Evil Hand". As a physician Dr. Griggs and his wife
			were viewed as a family of social standing. But Elizabeth was known as a servant to the
			household and not as an adopted daughter.</p>
<p>In 1692 Elizabeth was around 17 years old, making her one of the oldest of the original
			set of afflicted girls. Along with Elizabeth Parris, Abby Williams and Anne Putnam,
			Elizabeth started the accusations with claims of being tortured by specters of certain
			members of the community. The reasons behind the start of the accusations are somewhat
			unclear. There are many theories of why the young girls accused people of witchcraft
			ranging from the hysteria to the social and economic set up of the village of the time.
			In The Devil in the Shape of a Woman, Carol Karlsen researched some of the accusing
			girls and suggests that they may have behaved as they did due to the fact that many of
			them felt that their future was uncertain. As orphans, society looked at them in a
			different light. Most of the girls had no monetary or emotional support from direct
			family members. As Karlsen states, that the frontier wars, "had left their father's
			estates considerably diminished, if not virtually destroyed. Little if anything remained
			for their dowries. With few men interested in women without dowries, the marriage
			prospects of these women, and thus their long-term material well being, looked
			especially grim (227)". Elizabeth Hubbard, like most of the other accusing girls, was a
			servant with very dismal if any prospects for the future. Karlsen goes on to suggest the
			afflicted were able to use their dramatic possession performances to "focus the
			communities' concern on their difficulties". This was the one situation in which
			Elizabeth Hubbard and the others accusing girls had the respect and attention of the
			community. Karlsen thinks that this was the girls way of dealing with the oppression
			they felt as orphans within Puritan society (226-230). We can never know exactly why
			Elizabeth Hubbard accused so many people of witchcraft but from the documents we can
			read some of her testimony and draw conclusions about the kind of girl she was.</p>
<p>By the end of the trial Elizabeth Hubbard had testified against twenty-nine people,
			seventeen of whom were arrested, thirteen of those were hanged and two died in jail. As
			a strong force behind the trials, she was able to manipulate both people and the court
			into believing her. One way she and the other girls did this was through their
			outrageous fits in the courtroom. The fits, they would claim, were brought on by the
			accused. Elizabeth was especially known for her trances. She spent the whole of
			Elizabeth Procter's trial in a deep trance and was unable to speak. The original
			documents state that Elizabeth testified that in April 1692 "I saw the Apperishtion of
			Elizabeth procktor the wife of john procktor sen'r and she immediately tortor me most
			greviously all most redy to choak me to death....and so she continewed afflecting of me
			by times till the day of hir examination being the IIth of April and then also I was
			tortured most greviously during the time of hir examination I could not spake a word and
			also severall times sence the Apperishtion of Elizabeth procktor has tortured me most
			greviously by biting pinching and allmost choaking me to death urging me dreadfully to
			writ in hir [devil's] book" (Salem Witchcraft Papers). At the trials in which she was
			able to speak, she usually charged the accused with pretty much the same thing. An
			example is the case of Sarah Good. She testified "I saw the apprehension of Sarah Good
			who did most greviously afflect me by pinching and pricking me and so she continuewed
			and then she did also most greviously afflecct and tortor me also during the time of her
			examination and also severall times sence hath afflected me and urged me to writ in her
			book." This type of spectral accusation was typical of all the girls. Elizabeth's used
			it against the twenty-nine people.</p>
<p>However, some witnesses came forward and testified against the character of aggressive
			Elizabeth. She was not charged as a witch but James Kettle and Clement Coldum both took
			the stand and attempted to show that Elizabeth was religiously deviant. Coldum stated
			that one night when he was taking Elizabeth home form church on his horse "she desired
			me to ride faster, I asked why; she said the woods were full of Devils, &amp; said ther
			&amp; there they be, but I could se none; then I put on my horse, &amp; after I had rid
			a while, she told me I might ride softer, for we had out rid them. I asked her is she
			was not afraid of the Devil, she answered me no, she could discourse with the Devil as
			well as with me, &amp; further saith not; this I am ready to testifie on Oath if called
			thereto, as witness my hand." Elizabeth was a girl with a vivid and powerful
			imagination. However, the fact that she was not afraid to speak about her relationship
			with devil is also intriguing since by May 29th (the date Coldum claimed the event took
			place) she had already begun to help to condemn people for committing witchcraft and
			conspiring with the Devil. Another member of the village, James Kettle, stated that
			Elizabeth "speack severall untruths in denying the sabath day and saying she had not ben
			to [church] meeting that day but had only bean up to James houltons this I can testifie
			to if called: as witnes my hand." He seems to be trying to infer that Elizabeth may not
			be as pious as others had seen her. However, statements such as this did not discredit
			Elizabeth as a truthful witness to the court. She continued throughout the entire trials
			to be a leading accuser.</p>
<p>The combination of a lonely upbringing in which there was little hope for a future and
			Elizabeth's vivid imagination and fascination with the devil contributed to her actions
			which lead to the unjustified executions of many. Nothing is known of what happened to
			Elizabeth Hubbard after the trials were over.</p>

<h3>Mercy Lewis</h3>

Mercy Lewis Born in Falmouth, Maine in 1675, Mercy Lewis lost both her
parents to Indian attacks and became an orphan at a young age.
Dislocated from her family, like many of the accusing girls in Salem
Village, she resided first as a servant with Reverend George Burroughs
and then later with the family of Thomas Putnam to whom she was
distantly related. As a friend of Ann Putnam and the other girls
involved in the witchcraft accusations, Mercy herself became one of the
most consistent and vocal accusers during the 1692 witchcraft trials in
Salem.

<h3>
			Mercy Lewis
		</h3>
<p>Written By Meghan Carroll, 2001 and Jenny Stone, 2002</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2002</p>
<p>"I veryly believe in my heart," began 19 -year-old Mercy Lewis on April 19, 1692, "that
			Giles Corey is a dreadful wizzard." Lewis's confidence in herself was not unique to her
			accusation of Corey during the Salem Witchcraft Trials. Throughout the months plagued by
			chaos and confusion in Salem Village, Mercy Lewis acted as a member of the core group of
			accusing young women in the Village, blatantly accusing several persons of afflicting
			herself and her friends. Besides Giles Cory, Mercy Lewis accused Bridget Bishop, Mary
			Lacey, Sr., Susannah Martin, John Willard, Nehemiah Abbot, Jr., Sarah Wilds, and her
			former guardian, George Burroughs. </p>
<p>Mercy Lewis was born in Falmouth, Maine in 1675. The Lewis family lived in Maine until an
			Indian attack killed all of Mercy's extended family. In the Devil's Snare historian Mary
			Beth Norton suspects that Mercy's parents were killed in a later attack witnessed by
			Mercy herself. This tragic event cemented Mercy's connection between the Wabanaki
			Indians and Satan. The settlers came to fear death, captivity, and torture by the
			Indians. "In light of the perceived alliance between Satan and the Wabanakis, such
			suffused dread could easily have been vocalized in what became the commonplace
			description of the devil's threats to 'tear [the afflicted] to pieces' if they did not
			comply with his demands." Mercy testified to one of the witch conventions and reported
			that they were singing biblical passages regarding God's judgment of the heathen.</p>
<p>As a result of being orphaned, Mercy was sent to live as a servant with Reverend George
			Burroughs in Maine and then later to the household of Thomas Putnam in Salem Village. At
			the Putnam household, Lewis befriended Ann Putnam and her cousin Mary Walcott who were
			among the first to make claims of affliction by specters of witches. From her previous
			experience, Mercy was chief source of information about George Burroughs and the Hobbs
			family in Maine. To support their accusations, Mercy Lewis and the other girls continued
			to display spectral "evidence" of affliction. In one notable incident, Lewis is reported
			by Edward Putnam to have been drawn helplessly by an unseen force across a room directly
			towards a burning hearth while in the presence of an accused Martha Corey. Norton notes
			that Mercy displayed her leadership in the core group of accusers at least two times.
			She dismissed Ann Jr.'s claim against Nehemiah Abbott Jr. by saying that Ann was
			mistaken and "essentially single-handedly... prevented [Mary] Easty from being freed"
			when all other accusations had been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the girls, including Mercy Lewis, actually were afflicted? The
			position taken by Bernard Rosenthal in Salem Story considers two possible explanations.
			Either the girls were experiencing psychological disorders or they were simply frauds,
			and decides in favor of fraud. Nineteenth century historian Charles Upham, author of
			Salem Witchcraft, suggests a mixture of explanations "credulity, hallucination, and the
			delirium of excitement" to account for the girls' behavior.</p>
<p> Regardless of what may have fueled the incessant accusations, the fact remains that the
			girls accused innocent persons of witchcraft, costing many of them their lives.
			Historian Carol Karlsen in her book Devil in the Shape of a Woman attempts to explain
			the girls' afflictions as a response to their personal insecurities -- both economic and
			social. Mercy Lewis's case illustrates Karlsen's point well. Lewis experienced a
			traumatized childhood and lived in relatively insecure social and economic
			circumstances. As an orphan, she had no money or dowry to offer in marriage, so the
			chances of obtaining a husband and thus escaping her social position of servitude must
			have seemed bleak. Indeed, Rev. John Hale noted in his Modest Inquiry, two of the
			"afflicted" Salem girls were anxious about their marriage prospects. Norton draws
			attention to the Indian attacks in many of the girls' pasts and comments that the status
			of the accusers shifted from lowest to highest in the family and community. Daily life
			changed because the girls stopped doing their chores and neighbors constantly visited to
			see them perform. This was especially prominent at the Putnam household where Mercy
			lived because so many of the women living there were afflicted. Boyer and Nissenbaum,
			who cite primarily socio-economic causes for the witchcraft trials, might agree that
			these girls -- who possessed essentially no social standing before the trials -- were
			greatly empowered by their accusations. Moreover, many of the accused persons are
			examples of people who managed to climb the social ladder or become assertive women --
			both feats that Mercy Lewis was unable to accomplish. Furthermore, because Mercy Lewis
			was not involved in the initial accusations but rather joined Ann Putnam, Abigail
			Williams, and Elizabeth Hubbard later in the game, it seems that perhaps a desperate
			need for social empowerment and belonging were strong underlying motives.</p>
<p> Finally, it may be asked, "What did an accuser hope to achieve by naming a person as a
			witch?" No one's socio-economic status improved as a result of the trials, and most of
			the accused suffered financial losses. Mercy Lewis herself did not marry until late in
			life and then only after she had given birth to her first child. Perhaps Bernard
			Rosenthal's response to the question is most appropriate. He replies with a quotation
			from Herman Melville who simply asks, "How much money did the devil make by gulling

<h3>Elizabeth Parris</h3>
<p>At nine years old, Elizabeth Parris, daughter of Salem Village 
      minister Rev. Samuel Parris, played a key role in the beginnings of the 
      witchcraft trials. Curious to know her future marital status , Elizabeth, 
      together with her cousin Abigail Williams, cautiously experimented with 
      fortune telling. Her behavior led to the first three accusations of witches. 
      Trying to shield the involvement of his immediate family, the Rev. Samuel 
      Parris, took Abigail from home and placed her in the home of Stephen Sewall 
      in Salem, where she eventually recovered. She could not have predicted that 
      these innocent attempts at predicting the future would lead to the largest 
      and most deadly witch-hunt in American history. </p>

<h3>
			Elizabeth Parris
		</h3>
<p>Written By Sarah-Nell Walsh</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Elizabeth (Betty) Parris was nine years old when the witchcraft epidemic broke out in
			Salem, and she actively participated in its beginning. Elizabeth, a sweet girl, had
			difficulty facing the stark realities of predestination and damnation that her father,
			Reverend Samuel Parris, preached to her. Elizabeth Parris lived in a period of economic
			uncertainty and yearned to know what lay in her future.</p>
<p>In the dark winter days of 1691, Elizabeth Parris and her cousin Abigail Williams began
			to undertake experiments in fortune telling, using a device known as a "venus glass." A
			venus glass consists of an egg white suspended in water in which one could see shapes
			and figures. The girls mainly focused on their future social status, and specifically on
			the trade in which their husbands would be employed. These fortune telling secrets were
			shared with other young girls in the area. On one occasion, the glass revealed the
			horrendous specter of a coffin, which, as Rev. John Hale reported in A Modest Inquiry
			into the Nature of Witchcraft, (1702) led to "diabolical molestation.". And it is out of
			these childish beginnings that the Salem witchcraft outbreak began.</p>
<p>Betty Parris' afflictions started innocently in January when she began to forget errands,
			was unable to concentrate, and seemed rapt in secret preoccupation. She could not
			concentrate at prayer time and barked like a dog when her father would rebuke her. She
			screamed wildly when she heard the "Our Father" prayer and once hurled a Bible across
			the room. After these episodes, she sobbed distractedly and spoke of being damned. She
			seemed to see damnation as inevitable, perhaps because of her practicing fortune
			telling, which was regarded as a demonic activity.. Reverend Samuel Parris believed that
			prayer could cure her odd behavior, but his efforts were ineffective.</p>
<p>Nobody knows precisely what the Betty Parris and her girls friends were experiencing, but
			it manifested itself as odd postures, foolish and ridiculous speech, distempers, and
			fits. John Hale in A Modest Inquiry described the affliction that the girls suffered by
			saying they looked as if they "were bitten and pinched by invisible agents; their arms,
			necks, and backs turned this way and that way, and returned back again, so as it was
			impossible for them to do of themselves, and beyond the power of Epileptick fits, or
			natural disease to effect. Sometimes they were taken dumb, their mouths stopped, their
			throats choked, their limbs wracked and tormented so as might move a heart of stone to
			sympathize with them." The local physician, William Griggs, diagnosed Elizabeth Parris
			as being afflicted by the "Evil Hand," commonly known as witchcraft. Rev. Samuel Parris
			thought it was "a very sore rebuke and humbling providence that the Lord ordered the
			horrid calamity to break out first in [his] family." Since the sufferers of witchcraft
			were believed to be the victims of a crime, the community set out to find the
			perpetrators.</p>
<p>On February 29, 1692, under intense adult questioning, the afflicted girls named Sarah
			Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba as their tormentors. Elizabeth Parris testified at these
			trials that she was tormented by spectral visions of these women. During their trials,
			Elizabeth would cry out when the accused moved her arms, legs, or head, as if the
			accused was injuring her from across the room. Elizabeth Parris was also involved in the
			conviction of Martha Corey. At Martha Corey's trial, the afflicted girls sat together,
			and what Martha did, they all did. If she shifted her feet they did so too, and fell to
			stamping their feet. If she bit her lips, they yelled that she had bitten theirs, and
			showed the magistrates tht they bled." .</p>
<p>Understandably, Mrs. Parris was worried about the health of her daughter and she
			protested against using her as a witch finder. At the end of March, Betty was sent to
			live with Rev. Samuel Parris' distant cousin, Stephen Sewall, in Salem. This technique
			of isolation stopped most of her symptoms, but she still had visions after leaving the
			Parris household. On March 25, Elizabeth "related that the great Black Man came to her,
			and told her, if she would be ruled by him, she should have whatsoever she desired, and
			go to a Golden City" (Lawson). Mrs. Sewall told Elizabeth that it had been the Devil who
			had approached her "and he was a Lyar from the Beginning, and bid her tell him so, if he
			came again: which she did" (Lawson).</p>
<p>In 1710, Elizabeth Parris finally found the answer to the question she had been searching
			for in her homemade crystal ball. She married Benjamin Baron, a yeoman, trader,
			cordwainer, and shoemaker, in Sudbury and led a very ordinary existence. She and
			Benjamin bore four children, Thomas, Elizabeth Jr., Catherine, and Susanna. Elizabeth
			Parris survived her husband by six years, succumbing to illness in their Concord home on
			March 21, 1760 (Marilyn Roach).</p>

<h3>Ann Putnam, Jr.</h3>
<p>Ann Putnam, Jr. played a crucial role in the witchcraft trials of 1692. 
She was twelve years old at the time, and she was one of the first to
join Betty Parris and Abigail Williams as an "afflicted child".  Though
she is easily despised for her role as one of the most persistent
accusers in the trials, it is important to view her in the context of
her socially prominent family.  Her mother was also afflicted, and her
father and many other Putnams gave testimony against the accused during
the trials.  When attempting to make a judgment on Ann, it is important
to remember that she was very young and impressionable and thus easily
influenced by her parents and other adults.  Fourteen years later she
admitted that she had lied, deluded by the Devil.</p>

<h3>
			Ann Putnam, Jr.
		</h3>
<p>Written by Kate Alvarez, 2002</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Fall Semester 2002</p>
<p>The young Ann Putnam was the daughter of Thomas Putnam and Ann Putnam, Sr. She is listed
			in every account as one of the "afflicted girls" and her name appears over 400 times in
			the court documents. She was twelve years old when the Salem Witch Trials began in 1692.
			By the time they were over, she had accused nineteen people, and had seen eleven of them
			hanged.</p>
<p>Ann suffered her first fits on February 25, 1692, along with Betty Hubbard. During her
			torment, she cried out against Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne. Because Betty
			Parris, Abigail Williams, and Ann Putnam, Jr. were too young to testify, their
			accusations had to be endorsed by adults in the village, including her father and other
			leaders in Salem Village church. Ann's court performances have become notorious. She and
			the other girls would fall to the ground and writhe as if in agony, claiming that the
			specters of the accused were tormenting them. She would scream that she was being
			pinched or bitten, choked or that her life was being threatened if she did not sign the
			Devil's book. One of many such instances is recorded in the case of Martha Carrier: when
			asked, "who hurts you?" Ann replies, "Goody Carrier, she bites me, pinches me, &amp;
			tells me she would cut my throat, if I did not signe her book." As often happened in the
			course of the Salem episode, there was little other evidence to convict. Consciously or
			unconsciously, Ann stuck pins into herself on more than one occasion, claiming that the
			it was done by the specters of the accused.</p>
<p> Common history has painted Ann and her young peers as selfish, vicious fakers who fueled
			the witchcraft trials out of boredom or spite. This portrait, however, is somewhat
			flawed as it appears that, in Ann's case at least, the parents of the afflicted must
			have had a strong influence with the child, as did the other adult accusers. Initially,
			Ann was fed names by her parents and minister. Her father was an influential church
			leader and became an aggressive accuser of witches. Her mother was a fearful woman,
			still mourning the death of her infant daughter, and, later, she claimed that she
			herself was attacked by witches. Though many of the people Ann accused were those that
			her family or the Rev. Parris had quarreled with, she had other sources for her
			accusations. Mary Beth Norton has recently uncovered a connection between George
			Burroughs (whom Ann first accused) and Mercy Lewis, a nineteen year-old servant in the
			Putnam's household. Norton's groundbreaking research reveals the fact that Burroughs had
			been minister to the Maine town of Falmouth where both of Mercy's parents died during
			Indian attacks. Moreover, the afflicted girls seem to have entered into something of a
			conspiracy as time went on, so that in the case of Burroughs the name provided by the
			older Lewis was quickly echoed by Ann who initiated the accusation. </p>
<p>By the time the trials had come to an end, Ann was largely responsible for the deaths of
			several "witches" including Rebecca Nurse, Mary Easty, and George Burroughs. Her
			evidence sometimes added details post-hoc, and was crucial to the trials. Years later,
			in 1706, she stood with head bowed before the village church congregation, and the new
			minister, the Rev. Joseph Green, read aloud her confession. In this document, which was
			likely written by Rev. Green, Ann begs forgiveness for her part in the trials, saying
			that she was "deluded by the Devil" and wishes "to lie in the dust". Exactly how much
			guilt Ann was taking on in this apology is questionable, since it is more tailored to
			mending strife in the village than to allocating blame. In fact, the apology served as
			the spiritual testimony required to join the Puritan church and Ann was given Communion
			that same day. It is worth noting that she was the only one of the afflicted girls to
			make such a retraction. She died in 1715, unmarried.</p>

<h3>Mary Warren</h3>
<p>Born twenty years before the Salem Witch Trials began, Mary 
    Warren became one of the most rigorous accusers -- and also a defender and 
    confessor, a unique role among the accusing girls of Salem Village. As the 
    servant of John and Elizabeth Procter, opponents of the trials who thought 
    that the accusers should be punished, Mary encountered much resistance from 
    the two regarding her participation in the trials. Most significantly, Warren 
    introduced the possibility of fraud on the part of the accusing girls when 
    she stated that they "did but dissemble." Arthur Miller's play The Crucible 
    focuses on this unique aspect of Mary Warren's behavior. After her own confession, 
    Warren more actively participated in the accusations, including those against 
    the Procters. She was released from jail in June, 1692.</p>

<h3>
			Mary Warren
		</h3>
<p>Written By Devan Kirk </p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>At the time the Salem witchcraft trials began, Mary Warren was twenty years old and
			employed as a servant in the household of John Procter of Salem Village. Before her
			first formal examination on April 19, 1692, Warren participated mildly in the afflicted
			girls' accusations. Both John and Elizabeth Procter disagreed with the conduct of the
			trials. Therefore, when John Procter discovered that Mary Warren participated in the
			accusations he threatened to whip her until her senses returned. After Mary Warren
			stayed in town the night of Rebecca Nurse's examination, Samuel Sibley went to court and
			testified to Procter's opinions about the accusers and about Mary's participation in the
			accusations. Sibley claimed that: "Proctor replyed if they [the accusers] were let alone
			so we should all be Devils &amp; witches quickly they should rather be had to the
			Whipping post but he would fetch his jade [Mary Warren] Home &amp; thresh the Devil out
			of her &amp; more to the like purpose crying hang them, hang them. And also added that
			when she [Mary Warren] was first taken with fits he kept her close to the Wheel &amp;
			threatened to thresh her, &amp; then she had no more fits till the next day he was gone
			forth, &amp; then she must have her fits again firsooth" (SWP II: 683-684)..</p>
<p>Both of Mary Warren's parents died before this stage in her life. This situation forced
			Warren to become a servant and support herself since she had no funds or property to
			claim. Some of Mary's anxiety over the loss of her parents surfaced during the trials.
			The document in which John DeRich accused George Jacobs, Sr., states, "that Mary Warrens
			mother did appeare to this Deponent [John DeRich] this day with a white man and told him
			that goodwife Parker and Oliver did kill her." In her statement against Alice Parker,
			Mary Warren also claims that she killed her mother and afflicted her sister, Elizabeth,
			"she [Alice Parker] also told me she: bewiched my mother &amp; was a caus of her death:
			also that: she bewiched my sister: Eliz: that is both deaf &amp; dumb." Having no family
			and working for a man who beat her, it is not very surprising that, when accused of
			witchcraft herself, Mary Warren sought the public attention and legal protection of
			being an aggressive accuser of local witches.</p>
<p>On April 19, 1692, the magistrates in Salem began their questioning of Mary Warren. "I am
			innocent" were the first words out of her mouth. At this point in the trials no one had
			been hanged, so the clues as to how avoid being convicted had not yet been discovered.
			Mary Warren, however, quickly learned that assertions of innocence did not save, but
			following the judges' lead during questioning did help the defendant. Warren provided
			many evasive answers during her first examination, possibly because she was unsure as to
			how to not be convicted. Throughout this examination she continuously fell into fits,
			which often followed the fits of the other girls in the courtroom. At one point, Mary
			became so afflicted by the apparitions that tortured her that she had to be removed from
			the courtroom, and Bridget Bishop was then brought in for questioning:</p>
<p>"Afterwards she [Mary Warren] started up, &amp; said I will speak &amp; cryed out, Oh! I
			am sorry for it, I am sorry for it, &amp; wringed her hands, &amp; fell a little while
			into a fit again &amp; then came to speak, but immediately her Teeth were set, &amp;
			then she fell into a voilet fit, &amp; cryed out, Oh Lord help me, Oh good Lord save me!
			And then afterwards cryed again, I will tell, I will tell, &amp; then fell into a dead
			fit againe. And afterwards cryed, I will tell, they did, they did, they did, &amp; then
			fell into a violent fit again. After a little recovery she cryed I will tell, I will
			tell, they brought me to it; &amp; then fell into a fit again: which fits continuing,
			she was ordered to be had out, &amp; the next to be brought in, viz: Bridget Byshop"
			(SWP II: 794).</p>
<p>Even after being brought back into the courtroom, Warren continued her fits until the
			magistrates held a private meeting with her. After that, Mary Warren began to confess
			and, once she did, the court recorder noted that, "not one of the sufferers was
			afflicted during her examination after once she began to confess, though they were
			tormented before." While in prison, Mary Warren changed her story. Her fits lessened,
			and she began to implicate the Procters in the mysterious events occurring in Salem.
			Following the examination in prison, Warren faced two more examinations: one on April 21
			and the other on May 12. Now a confessed witch, Warren aggressively accused others of
			alliances with the devil. At this point, Warren actively accused the Procters of
			performing certain deeds, although she hesitated to call them a witch and a wizard. By
			the end of her examinations, Mary was established as an accuser, and she safeguarded her
			life by providing the magistrates with ample accusations and evidence.</p>
<p>Mary Warren's testimony did more than save her life, it also represented a turning point
			in the trials. For the first time fraud was introduced. Yet the judges made no move to
			aid the innocent, and they continued to encourage the accusers. In Edward Bishop, Sarah
			Bishop, and Mary Easty's complaint against Mary Warren they stated that, "for Said Mary
			warrin when I was Aflicted I thought I saw the Apparission of A hundred persons: for
			Shee said hir Head was Distempered that Shee Could not tell what Shee Said, And the Said
			Mary tould us that when Shee was well Againe Shee Could not Say that Shee saw any of
			Apparissons at the time Aforesaid -." During Warren's first examination, Elizabeth
			Hubbard "testifyed that a little after this Mary was well, she then said that the
			afflicted persons did but dissemble." Both of these statements suggest that either
			Warren was mentally unstable, or that she and the accusers were participating in
			concocted lies. Keeping in mind the above statements, Mary's remarkable description in
			the prison of Giles Cory's clothes could possibly be explained by the fact that the
			accusers were "dissembling" - and not that Giles Cory was afflicting Mary at that very
			moment. In Salem Story, Bernard Rosenthal claims Warren understood that "cooperation
			with the accusers proved salutary" and that her decision to become an active accuser
			provided a great lesson to others who would later employ the same tactic.</p>

<h3>
			Mary Walcott
		</h3>
<p>By Kelly McCandlish</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Although eighteen year-old Mary Walcott was not the most notorious of the accusers, her
			role in the Salem witch trials was by no means minimal. She was one of the original
			girls to be afflicted; and it was her aunt, Mary Sibley, who decided to try some white
			magic to fend off the evil powers in the village. It was Sibley's idea to persuade
			Tituba and John Indian, slaves of the Rev. Samuel Parris, to make the "witch cake" to
			discover witches that resulted in Betty Parris and Abigail Williams making their first
			accusations.</p>
<p>Walcott's mother died when she was young and her father, Joseph Walcott, Captain of the
			Salem Village militia, married Deliverance Putnam thus making him the brother-in-law of
			Thomas Putnam, one of the most powerful men in the village. The family alliance made
			Mary Walcott the niece of Thomas Putnam and cousin of his twelve year-old daughter Ann
			Putnam, Jr., a household that also included Mercy Lewis, an orphaned servant girl, who,
			with Ann Putnam, Jr., became one of the most active accusers.</p>
<p>Mary Walcott was not an aggressive accuser. In her book, The Devil in Massachusetts,
			Marion Starkey describes Walcott as "a girl who could take possession calmly. Mary
			Walcott was to sit placidly knitting through a Dionysiac frenzy on the part of her
			companions." During the examination of Sarah Cloyce, Mary Walcott was calm. "She had
			brought her knitting with her, and became so intent on it that she clicked her needles
			no matter what devils rioted about her. Every so often she glanced up to confirm someone
			else's story" (Starkey 82). Walcott was always a passive accuser but she was
			occasionally afflicted with the more physical manifestations of witchcraft. When Mary
			Clarke, who had been accused by Mary Post on August 4, was obstinate in giving her
			confession, what Rosenthal describes as a "flurry of pins" ensued. Mary Warren appeared
			in court with one stuck one in her throat, and Susannah Sheldon had four in her hand and
			even the quiet Mary Walcott had one pin in her arm. When former minister of Salem
			Village, Deodat Lawson, returned to preach in Salem Village, he encountered Walcott at
			the tavern of Nathaniel Ingersoll. "Lawson by candlelight examined a mysterious set of
			teeth marks on the arm of one of the troubled girls, seventeen-year-old Mary
			Walcott."</p>
<p>In Salem Story, Bernard Rosenthal refers to Walcott as "an old standby" and one of the
			"regulars," a title he reserves for Ann Putnam, Sr., Elizabeth Hubbard, Mercy Lewis,
			Abigail Williams, Betty Parris, and Ann Putnam, Jr. Although she lacked the melodramatic
			behavior of her fellow accusers, Walcott is an interesting example in support of Carol
			Karlsen's theory. In her book The Devil in the Shape of a Woman, Karlsen suggests that
			many of these girls, being either orphaned or partially orphaned, feared for their
			social and economic security. Walcott allied herself with the interests of the
			influential Putnam family in Salem Village. An alliance with such a powerful dynasty
			ensured economic viability for the uncertain future she faced. Mary Walcott is an
			example of how teenage anxiety about the future could manifest itself in the form of
			socially destructive behavior.</p>

			Abigail Williams
		</h3>
<p>Written by Melissa M. Yost, 2002</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2002</p>
<p>Abigail Williams, aged 11 or 12 in 1692, played a major role in the Salem Witch trials as
			one of the prominent accusers. She lived with her uncle, the Rev. Samuel Parris, Salem
			Village's minister. Although it was ordinary practice for young girls to live with
			relatives to learn about housewifery, we know very little about Abigail, including where
			she was born and who her parents were.</p>
<p>The traditional story about the beginning of the Salem Witch trials tells of a "circle of
			young girls" practicing voodoo and fortune telling under the direction of Samuel Parris'
			Indian slave, Tituba. It is commonly suggested that the girls were interested in fortune
			telling because they wanted to know the occupation of their future husbands. Even though
			this version is perpetrated in historical works and literature, there is no record of
			any sort of group fortune telling in Parris's household or linkage between Tituba,
			voodoo, and the girls. Reverend Hale, a local minister, revealed in his 1702 work,
			Modest Enquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft, that he knew one of the afflicted girls
			had experimented with fortune-telling in order to find out her future husband's
			profession, but Reverend Hale fails to name the girl in question.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Norton's work, In the Devil's Snare extinguished the myth surrounding the
			beginning of the Salem Witch trials. According to historical fact, both Abigail and her
			9-year-old cousin Betty began showing signs of illness in mid-January 1692. When their
			behavior turned erratic, Samuel Parris called neighboring Reverend John Hale of Beverly
			to observe the two girls and their afflictions. Reverend Hale writes that the girls,
			"were bitten and pinched by invisible agents; their arms, necks and backs turned this
			way and that way and returned back again so as it was impossible for them to do of
			themselves and beyond the power of any Epileptic Fits or natural Disease to effects."
			Parris and other local ministers turned to prayer and fasting in hopes that Abigail and
			Betty would return to health. When the girls' strange behavior continued, Parris
			summoned Dr. William Griggs to examine them. Dr. Griggs determined that the girls were
			under the influence of an "Evil Hand."</p>
<p>With talk of witchcraft spreading in the Village, the girls were questioned about who was
			afflicting them. On February 29th 1692, a formal complaint was issued against Tituba,
			Sarah Osborne, and Sarah Good for afflicting Betty, Abigail, and other local girls such
			as Ann Putnam, Jr. who had began to suffer fits. Abigail Williams along with the other
			afflicted girls appeared at the trial hearings. In the presence of Good, Tituba, and
			Osborne Abigail suffered fits and outbursts. Abigail testified she "saw the apparition
			of said Sarah Good at her examination pinch Elizabeth Hubbard and set her into fits and
			also Elizabeth Parris and Ann Putnam, Jr."</p>
<p>Abigail's accusations continued and included complaints against Martha Cory, George
			Burroughs, Bridget Bishop, Elizabeth and John Proctor, Mary Easty, John Willard, Mary
			Witheridge, and Rebecca Nurse. Overall Abigail Williams made 41 legal complaints and
			gave formal testimony in seven cases. Bernard Rosenthal estimates she was involved in at
			least 17 capital cases. It is important to remember, however, that without the legal
			complaints of the adults the testimony of minors would have never been heard in court,
			as unmarried women and minors had no legal standing.</p>
<p>During Elizabeth Proctor's examination, Abigail revealed she witnessed Elizabeth's
			specter along with 40 other witches partake in a sacrament of blood drinking outside of
			the Parris house. She even named Sarah Cloyce and Sarah Good as the deacons presiding
			over the ceremony. Abigail went on to accuse Elizabeth's husband John Proctor whose
			specter sat on her chest at night and pinched her. She also accused Martha Cory's
			specter of tempting her to put her hand on the Devil's book. In addition, Rebecca
			Nurse's apparition tried to choke, pinch, and tempt Abigail into the fire. Abigail also
			accused Nurse of attending the Devil's sacrament.</p>
<p>It is not clear why Abigail suffered fits and went on to accuse many respectable people.
			Historians Norton and Roach speculate that it involved the attention she received. Young
			girls in Puritan society did not receive much consideration and perhaps Abigail,
			displaced from her immediate family, craved this unusual attention and authority over
			adults. It appears that some of her contemporaries were skeptical of Abigail's behavior.
			Joseph Hutchinson of Salem Village attempted to discredit Abigail's accusations and
			implicitly accused her of witchcraft. He testified that Abigail told him that she could
			now talk to the devil as well as she could converse with him.</p>
<p>Even though Abigail played a major role as an accuser at the beginning of the trials,
			especially in March, April, and May, she gave her last testimony on June 3rd 1692. There
			is no historical documentation suggesting why Abigail virtually disappeared from the
			court hearings. In addition, there are no records indicating what happened to Abigail
			after the events of 1692. It is suggested that she never married and died a single
			woman, but without any evidence we will never be quite certain.</p>

<h3>Tituba</h3>
<p>Tituba Indian holds one of the most infamous (yet still debated) places in the 
history of the Salem Witchcraft Trials. Tituba was an Indian slave in the service 
of Reverend Samuel Parris, in whose home the diagnosis of witchcraft was first 
made. She was the first accused (along with Sarah Osborne) and was also the first 
to confess. Tituba's confession set a precedent and pattern that would run the 
course of the trials -- accused witches confessed and then became accusers themselves, 
thereby validating the previous accusations and the need for continuing investigations 
and trials, as the court desired. Though Tituba was not executed for her participation 
as a "detestable Witch," she was forced to languish in jail for thirteen 
months after Parris refused to pay her imprisonment costs. She was finally freed 
from jail when an unknown person redeemed her jail fees and took her from the 
Village. Nothing is known about her life beyond Salem Village.

<h3>
			Tituba
		</h3>
<p>Written By Alyssa Barillari</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>In late February of 1692, Reverend Samuel Parris called in a doctor to examine his
			nine-year-old daughter, Betty, and eleven-year-old niece, Abigail Williams-both of whom
			were suffering from spontaneous fits. The children were soon diagnosed as victims of
			witchcraft, setting off an outbreak of panic and hysteria, which would sweep throughout
			Salem Village and its neighboring towns that year. Historians have long pointed the
			collective finger of blame at the Parris's slave, Tituba, one of the three women first
			accused of witchcraft, and the only member of this unfortunate trio to survive the
			year.</p>
<p>Many interpretations of the Salem Trials acknowledge the pivotal role Tituba's confession
			played in legitimizing the early suspicions and subsequent investigations of witchcraft,
			seizing on the vivid descriptions of the devil and his minions that she provided to the
			examining justices. A number of sources also assert that Tituba also introduced
			supernatural ideas to the "afflicted girls." These scholars claim Reverend Parris had
			purchased her in Barbados, unaware of the voodoo and witchcraft practices she would
			eventually undertake under the roof of the Salem parsonage.</p>
<p>However, the mantle of guilt so eagerly thrust upon Tituba may not be rightfully hers
			(and at the very least, not hers alone). Later investigations have only raised more
			questions about the very little verifiable information available on her. Most of the
			perceptions and understandings of Tituba, today commonly accepted as fact, are actually
			based on local tradition and fictional literature rather than actual court documents or
			eye-witness accounts. Admittedly, the legend of Tituba as the "Black Witch of Salem" (a
			posthumous appellation which immediately suggests interesting racial and class
			connotations) may be more mysterious and entertaining than the accurate historical
			extent of her influence on the Salem trials; nevertheless, the ways in which this myth
			has been constructed are fascinating as well.</p>
<p>In all of the court documents relating to the Witchcraft Trials, Tituba's identity is
			listed as that of an "Indian Woman, servant" (for example, Warrant vs. Tituba and Sarah
			Osborne -SWP 745). But as scholars have recently pointed out, somewhere in the
			development of the Salem lore, Tituba's racial heritage has been transformed and
			confused-thus she appears in texts variously as "Negro," "half-breed," "colored," or
			"half-Indian, half-Negro." Assumptions about her origins range from the island of
			Barbados to Africa to Native American. This confusion necessarily complicates any
			understanding of the consequential and critical part traditionally assigned to Tituba;
			we must consider how racial stereotypes and presumptions have contributed to the varying
			amounts of blame she is forced to bear.</p>
<p>Truthfully, Tituba's story may never be clearly sorted out. Her status as a slave
			constrains any attempts to uncover official records and papers relating to her. The
			little glimpse of her life that is available is provided only by the court transcripts
			themselves. Though Tituba's words may resonate to us through the court records, she
			cannot tell her version of the events leading up to the Trials, she cannot share her own
			history and memory of Salem and life before it. In addition to Tituba's own recorded
			words, we can obtain some information based on what her contemporaries said of her.
			Beyond these strict limitations however, we can realistically draw no further
			conclusions as to her racial identity, affinity for witchcraft and stories of the
			occult, nor motivations for confessing to the accusations.</p>
<p>What we do know is from the historical documents is that Tituba was in fact a slave in
			the Parris home at the time of Betty and Abigail's initial sufferings. Tradition holds
			that she was married to another slave, John Indian, and the couple was purchased by
			Reverend Parris during time he spent in Barbados. Tradition, however, does not a history
			make. Tituba and John Indian did reside with the Parrises; Samuel Parris had a
			plantation in Barbados, and he owned two slaves after he returned to Boston, and she
			could have come from Barbados. However, the story that Tituba struck the "fatal spark"
			and ignited simmering tensions in Salem Village by enthralling the local teenage girls
			with her stories of African or Caribbean voodoo and magic spells must be recognized for
			what it is --a story. It was not her "voodoo spells and stories" which, in fact, caused
			the girls' initial hysterics but their practice of forbidden fortune telling.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the court records or contemporary accounts is Tituba said to have taught the
			practice of fortune telling to the girls in Rev Parris' house. The fortune telling
			technique that the girls' used, as reported by one of them to the Rev. John Hale, was an
			egg white in a glass of water. This was a commonly known device in New England at the
			time, and it was condemned by the Puritans as a demonic practice. According to the Rev.
			Hale, one of the girls saw a "specter in the likeness of a coffin" in the glass, and she
			and another girl fell into fits. Tituba did not confess to the teaching of fortune
			telling; she confessed to signing the Devil's book, flying in the air upon a pole,
			seeing a cats wolves, birds, and dogs, and pinching or choking some of the "afflicted"
			girls. She also said she was beaten by her owner, Rev. Parris, and was told to confess
			to witchcraft, which she did -- and what she confessed to was all culturally European,
			not African or Caribbean.</p>
<p>Tituba's confession, however, did ignite a "spark" in the court, especially when she
			named the other accused witches, Good and Osborne, as her accomplices. Confession is
			what the judges were looking for, and Tituba's "evidence" of a conspiracy of witches in
			Salem Village stimulated the court and the girls to find and convict more people.</p>

<h3>
			Ann Dolliver
		</h3>
<p>Written By Kristin Buckstad</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Ann Dolliver was the daughter of Rev. John Higginson of Salem Town and was unhappily
			married to Willliam Dolliver of Gloucester. Court records of 1683 show that complaints
			were made against William Dolliver for being idle and neglecting his family. In fact, he
			left the Massachusetts Bay Colony, abandoning Ann and her children with no means of
			support. Ann was forced to leave Gloucester with her children to return to her father's
			home in Salem where he and the town supported them. She retained her title of respect
			(Mrs.), but her social standing was compromised and her mental state soon declined.</p>
<p>Before June 1692 her situation was already on shaky grounds. But on June 6, when she was
			about 45 years old, she was arrested for "Witchcraft on the Bodys of Mary Warren and
			Susannah Sheldon." Only the warrant for Dolliver's arrest, the testimony of Elizabeth
			Nicholson against Dolliver, and the newly discovered pre-trial examination are known to
			scholars today. During her examination, Warren and Sheldon were present along with Mary
			Walcott. The examination was conducted on June 6 before Magistgrates Gedney, Hawthorne,
			and Corwin. Ann Dolliver's specter was portrayed as a particularly nasty one. The
			accusers reported that Dolliver's specter wanted to kill her own father out of spite.
			They also said that the specter of a dead child blamed Ann Dolliver for its murder. When
			the judges asked Ann if she possessed wax puppets, an indication of magic that the
			Puritans regarded as witchcraft, she replied that she did fourteen years ago, but only
			"because she thought she was bewitched and she read in a book: that told her; that that:
			was [the] way to afflict: them [that] had afflicted her." In other words, Ann Dolliver
			pleaded self-defense. When answering the question, "Mrs Dolliver did you never act
			witchcraft," she defended herself and implicitly confessed at the same time: "not with
			the intent to hurt anybody with it." She admitted to having done witchcraft in 1678 to
			protect herself and her family, but denied that she afflicted her accusers in 1692. Lack
			of further documentation makes determinations difficult, but it appears that Dolliver
			was released due to insufficient evidence or because of her questionable mental
			condition.</p>
<p>Her life did not improve after the trials ended. In a letter to her brother written in
			August 1693 (which, strangely, did not mention the witch trials), her father, Rev.
			Higginson, described her as suffering from "overbaring malloncolly, crazed in her
			understanding." As of 1705, she had been declared to be mentally incompetent (non compos
			mentis) and remained a dependent of her father.</p>
<p>Scholars do not address Ann Dolliver's case as often as others in the trials. Carol
			Karlsen's feminist study, however, examines her case. According to her analysis, which
			is based on gender roles in Puritan society, Ann Dolliver fits a socio-economic profile.
			While her father was prominent and wealthy, she was a deserted wife and was utterly
			dependent on her father. Caught between being single and being a widow, her situation
			was precarious. As such, Dolliver was practically impoverished at the time of her
			accusation. Her condition made her vulnerable to attack because, as a poor woman, the
			officials would be less likely to overlook charges launched against her. Also, she did
			not have a husband to deflect the charges. Basically, she was a poor and therefore
			vulnerable woman. Marshall Swan continues in this vein when he observes that mentally
			unstable women were often vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft at this time.</p>
<p>Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissembaum have a different place for Ann Dolliver. While she is
			not explicitly treated in their study, she cleanly fits their paradigm. They argue that
			the trials were based on the Village's anxieties. The more rural Salem Village was
			engaged in a struggle to obtain its independence from the prosperous seaport, Salem
			Town. Loyalty to the Town church or connections to the emerging capitalism in the Town
			represented opposition to this cause. Boyer and Nissenbaum find that the majority of
			accusers were connected to the Village and that the majority of the accused associated
			with the Town. Ann Dolliver fits into this scheme because her father was a minister in
			Salem Town. Her father had also defended one of the accused witches, sarah Buckley, thus
			contradicting the girls' testimony. Ann Dolliver may therefore hve been targeted as a
			way of hitting back at her father. Her strong connections to the Town made her an
			adequate scapegoat for what her father represented.</p>

<h3>Philip English</h3>
<p>Philip English, the most successful merchant in Salem Town, 
    emigrated from Isle of Jersey as Philippe D'Anglois in 1670. He rose out of 
    obscurity to become the largest entrepreneur and ship owner in Salem, and 
    he married into an established Salem merchant family. He and his wife were 
    arrested of witchcraft in late April 1692, but both escaped to New York for 
    the duration of the trials. No attempts were made to bring English back to 
    face trial. During his hiding in New York, English's wealthy estate was pillaged 
    at the hands of Sheriff Corwin, and little restitution was ever made for his 
    losses.

<h3>
			Philip English
		</h3>
<p>Written By Anne Taite Austin</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Philip English is an interesting figure in the Salem witch trials because his prominence
			in the community raises questions about the pattern of accusations; his escape from jail
			and the gallows provides insight about the politics behind the trials; and his
			post-trials experience highlights how the Colony attempted to rectify the fiscal wrongs
			committed against the victims of the trials.</p>
<p>A warrant was issued for English's arrest on April 30 1692, but he was nowhere to be
			found, and another warrant had to be issued on May 6. His wife, Mary, had been taken
			into custody one week earlier. Facing indictments from Mercy Lewis, Susannah Sheldon and
			William Beale, in late May, Philip finally surfaced from hiding and joined his wife in
			John Arnold's jail in Boston, perhaps because his avoidance of the law was hurting their
			legal situation. Philip and Mary stayed in Boston for nine weeks under lenient
			supervision until the eve of their expected return to their August trial in Salem. But
			instead of returning, the couple escaped to New York where they stayed throughout the
			duration of the trials. Men of prominence including Rev. Joshua Moody of Boston,
			Governor Phips of Massachusetts and Governor Fletcher of New York apparently aided the
			Englishs' escape into safe hands. New York was a predominantly Dutch settlement, and it
			was known for its religious tolerance and disapproval of the proceedings in Salem.</p>
<p>After Governor Phips officially ended the trials in May 1693, Philip English returned to
			Salem with his wife in good spirits. But he soon became disheartened by the pillaging of
			his wealthy estate at the hands of Sheriff Corwin and the death of his wife Mary by
			consumption during childbirth a year later. English fought through several petitions for
			restitution of his estate (which in 1692 included 14 buildings, 21 sail vessels, a
			wharf, and a warehouse). He estimated damages of 1,183 pounds of which he was only
			awarded 60 during his lifetime and another 200 at his death. The legality of such land
			and estate seizures is complex, but it remains that several authorities including Phips,
			English's ally, knew that Essex County Sheriff George Corwin was not forwarding the
			money to the colony or the Crown as he claimed. This brief sketch of Philip English's
			involvement in the trial raises many questions - one of course being the reason he was
			accused - especially considering the fact that he was allowed to disappear.</p>
<p>The biography of Philip English, born Philippe d'Anglois in 1651, begins hazily as
			historians have had little luck discerning his past before he came to Salem in 1670. Of
			French Huguenot descent, he immigrated from the Isle of Jersey into the mercantile class
			of Salem town. From this point, historians have had little trouble keeping track of him
			because quickly upon his arrival, he established himself as a successful trading
			merchant. His success increased when he married Mary, the only daughter of William
			Hollingsworth, the head of a prominent shipping legacy and longstanding family in Salem
			and Massachusetts. This brief introduction sets up several characteristics that have
			been argued as the root of English's involvement with the witch trials: 1) English was
			an immigrant 2) with Protestant tendencies who 3) was successful in the changing economy
			of Massachusetts. In sum, English was an outsider to the community. Despite his
			involvement within the community on economic, political and social realms, he existed as
			an outside threat to the harmony of the Salem community.</p>
<p>First, he was French, and a Huguenot at that. Bryan F. Le Beau's essay, "Philip English
			and the witchcraft hysteria," emphasizes English's non-Puritan religious background even
			though he and Mary attended services and baptized their children at Salem's First
			Church. His wife was even admitted into full communion in 1681. Many legends report
			English to have been hostile towards the Puritan faith, but conflict did not arise until
			long after the trials in 1714 when he gave money to help erect an Anglican church in a
			nearby town. At this point tension arose as English refused to pay his church taxes and
			as Le Beau's essay cites, he spoke out feverishly against Rev Noyes, one of the Puritans
			ministers during the trials, as having "murdered" John Proctor and Rebecca Nurse.
			Although English later rebels against the Puritan religion, there is no documented basis
			to believe that he his religion was an outright problem with the Puritans at the time of
			the accusations. Nonetheless, his French Protestant descent made him different and
			consequently vulnerable.</p>
<p>English's personal character probably caused more discontent than his Anglicanism. Having
			many land parcels in various locations made him liable to frequent episodes of
			litigation. The lawsuit brought against him by William Beale involved a heated debate
			about the boundaries of a piece of land in Marblehead. English's open hostility against
			Beale would come back to haunt him when Beale accused English's specter of witchcraft
			two years later during the trials. English's consistent land disputes when coupled with
			the town's prejudice against the superior style in which his family lived exposed
			English to a volatile hostility.</p>
<p>The rich lifestyle of the English's may caused resentment among Salem villagers, but more
			accurately, the fact that an Anglican immigrant merchant could find such spectacular
			financial success in Salem was especially disturbing. According to Boyer and Nissenbaum
			in Salem Possessed, "if one had to choose the single person most representative of the
			economic and social transformations which were overtaking Salem - and Massachusetts as a
			whole - in the late seventeenth century, Philip English might as well be that person."
			Boyer and Nissenbaum that claim factions had arisen between Salem Village and Salem
			based on economic and political relationship. English was incredibly successful in the
			young mercantile industry rather than in farming, and was thus representative of the new
			economy that many farmers perceived as a political threat to the Villagers' desire for
			independence from Salem and its accompanying social style. Infuriating the farmers,
			perhaps, merchants in Salem were taking prominence in local politics. Philip English had
			been appointed as a town's selectman in March of 1692 - one month before he was accused
			of witchcraft.</p>
<p>Indeed, English fits into Boyer and Nissenbaum's analysis of the witch trials as an
			outgrowth of pre-existing tensions along economic and political lines, but more broadly,
			English became a representative of all that Salem Villagers distrusted: he lived a
			lavish lifestyle, he was Anglican, he was an immigrant, he sympathized with other French

<p>Mary Ireson is one of the minor characters of the Salem witch trials. 
However, from the one substantive document that has recently surfaced,
we can gain insight into the often-unfair mechanisms of the witch trials
court  - especially how the female accusers' courtroom behavior could

<h3>
			Mary Ireson
		</h3>
<p>Written by Meghan Fleming, 2002</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2002</p>
<p>Mentioned in only a few documents, Mary Ireson does not emerge as one of the leading
			figures in the tragedy of the Salem witch trials. However, the details recorded in her
			grand jury hearing, which has recently been discovered, makes it possible to see how
			such a trial unfolds. While even this type of detail would not make her unusual among
			the accused persons, Mary Ireson's court room interrogation imparts a human
			element to these ruthless proceedings. Readers can easily see the utter fear that was
			gripping her -- fear not only for her life, but also fear of the courtroom and its
			unknown proceedings. The naivete that she conveys in her responses to the interrogation
			is endearing, as is the obvious sincerity with which she answers the questions.</p>
<p>The account of Ireson's examination begins even before she enters the courtroom by
			recording that the justices and afflicted girls joined together for a "prayer time"
			before commencing the examination. During this time of prayer, the afflicted girls,
			including Elizabeth Booth, Susanna Sheldon, Mary Walcott, and Mary Warren, fell into
			fits, blaming Mary Ireson, whose interrogation was only moments away.</p>
<p> When Mary Ireson entered the courtroom, she did so accompanied by her sister. Whether
			this was an intentional trap or not, it cleverly forced the girls to validate their
			claims of having "seen" Mary Ireson's specter with their ability to then recognize her
			in person and distinguish her from her sister. The justices ordered the afflicted girls
			to observe the two women and see if it was Mary or her sister who had afflicted them,
			which also means that the judge himself had to have made the distinction for the girls
			between Mary and her sister, possibly foiling the Ireson's plan to trap the afflicted
			girls in their lies. The afflicted girls remained confident that it was indeed the woman
			wearing the riding hood, obviously meaning Mary. It then becomes more likely that Mary
			had intentionally brought her sister in with her when the judge then questioned Mary,
			saying "Do you not see how you are discovered?" Implied in this is her assumed aim of
			going "undiscovered," of proving the afflicted girls unable to recognize her.</p>
<p>Mary responds genuinely though, saying that she might be enduring this hardship of being
			accused because of some sins in her life, and she readily admits to having been of a bad
			temper. Unfortunately, this evidence might have proved more damning than Mary ever
			intended, as admissions of anger or jealousy or anything affiliated with a "bad temper"
			had possibly diabolic implications within the context of seventeenth century Puritan
			Salem. She insisted, however, that while she might have been of a "bad temper," she was
			not guilty of witchcraft. The afflicted girls then fell to the ground whenever she
			glanced at them, and became normal again only when they were touched by her. The "touch
			test," as it was called, was regarded as a conclusive way of determining who was
			afflicting another person -- if they ceased their fits and convulsions at the touch of
			the alleged witch, then it was that person who was regarded as the responsible culprit.
			The girls charged Ireson with hurting them, and as they recovered from their fits, also
			charged her with hurting others.</p>
<p> Mary Walcott was the only one who had never seen Ireson before, but all the girls were
			certain that indeed she was the woman who had been afflicting them. Mary Warren said
			that Ireson had brought the Devil's book to her to sign a month before, and
			Susannah Sheldon said that even earlier that day Ireson had brought same Devil's
			book to her and threatened that if she did not sign it she would "tear her throat
			out."</p>
<p>At this point in the record of the courtroom exchange it was noted that Mary
			Ireson's eyes were frozen as though fixed on something in the distance. While
			this could be readily explained as Ireson's terror of being in a courtroom on
			trial for her life, her aggressive accusers chose to explain it by saying that she was
			staring at the Devil in front of her, and the afflicted girls even went as far as to say
			that the Devil was making his appearance to beg her not to confess to being a witch. At
			this point, Mary Ireson's uncle, a man named only as Fuller, urged her to confess
			and thereby "break the snare of the devil." While we cannot tell if her uncle was
			convinced that she was guilty or if his interest was in saving his niece's life
			(as at this point, it was understood that confessing could be equated with surviving),
			his imploring only roused Mary Ireson to say that she didn't know that she was
			even in the snare of the devil.</p>
<p>Her next words brim with innocence, as she asked the judges if "she might be a witch and
			not know it." The court responded that that would be impossible; the judges needed
			people to be aware of their own witching nature as confession was regarded as the most
			significant piece of evidence. She replied by saying she could not confess until she was
			granted more insight into the situation and the nature of her guilt. This type of
			manipulation is also seen in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, in which the
			judges bring a person's private conscience into the public arena, and then use it
			against them. What makes Ireson's trial interesting is that her innocence and
			posture during the proceedings reveal to a modern audience a woman who is most certainly
			innocent of witchcraft charges. However sparsely her presence emerges in the documents,
			it is a significant presence in and of itself. The courtroom transcript reminds readers
			that indeed, at the heart of this controversy, standing on the witness stand and
			frequently damning themselves, are not just characters or actors but human beings whose
			very lives would be taken from them as a result of these terrifying and deliberately
			entrapping proceedings.</p>

<h3>Margaret Jacobs</h3>
<p>Although she was only seventeen at the time of the Salem Witch Trials, Margaret 
Jacobs knew that the safest way out of the witchcraft accusations directed at 
her was through confession. She employed this equation in her initial accusations 
against former minister of Salem Village, George Burroughs, and the patriarch 
of the Jacobs family, her own grandfather, George Jacobs, Sr. Although her accusations, 
among others, led to the execution of both men, it is not her accusations that 
make her case of interest. It is her eventual retraction of these accusations 
and voicing of her own conscience that make Jacobs an icon of strength and integrity. 
While other accusers escaped death by relentlessly accusing one person after another, 
Margaret Jacobs sat in jail facing death for her refusal to stand by her initial 
accusations and confession of witchcraft.

<h3>
			Margaret Jacobs
		</h3>
<p>Written By Kelly McCandlish</p>
<p> Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Sixteen year-old Margaret Jacobs was the daughter of George Jacobs, Jr. After her father
			was accused of witchcraft and fled arrest from Salem Village, Margaret Jacobs was left
			in the care of her mentally unbalanced mother and had to fight Judge Hawthorne and his
			infamous court alone. Abandoned both by her father and by uncle, Daniel Andrews, who had
			also fled arrest, she confessed to having participated in witchcraft in order to save
			herself from a trial. To strengthen her confession, she named her own grandfather,
			George Jacobs, Sr. as a witch, knowing that he had already been accused by others --
			Marcy Lewis, Mary Walcott, and Sarah Churchill. Later, stricken by her conscience, she
			recanted her confession. According to Marion Starkey in the Devil in Massachusetts ,
			Margaret "confessed only under pressure of fright when she had seen the accusing girls
			tumble down before her, and out of terror of hanging." This statement emphasizes not
			only the guilt of Margaret's conscience, but her knowledge and the knowledge of all
			accusers, as to the nature of the trials at this stage. If you confessed and named other
			people as witches, you would not be tried or executed. Even at the price of her freedom,
			Jacobs could not lie. In Starkey's words, she preferred a "death with a quiet conscience
			than to live in such horror." The document in which she repudiated her confession and
			accusations was produced in court but had no effect on the judges, who wished to believe
			her confession. Margaret was, however, allowed to visit her grandfather in jail the day
			before his death and seek his forgiveness. George Jacobs, Sr. did hear of Margaret's
			courageous act before he was put to death and added a special provision for her in his
			will.</p>
<p>On August 20, the day after her grandfather was executed, Margaret wrote a moving letter
			to her father. She stated, "The reason of my Confinement [in jail] is this, I having,
			through the magistrates Threatenings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed
			several things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding of my own
			Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! The terrors of a wounded Conscience who can
			bear and God knows how soon I shall be put to death"(Salem Witchcraft Papers.</p>
<p>Bernard Rosenthal in Salem Story puts it best when he says, "One does not often find
			people with the strength of Margaret Jacobs," especially at such a young age. He is
			absolutely right. It is rare to find someone willing to die for truth alone. Margaret
			was not the only woman accusing her grandfather of witchcraft. He could have been
			executed on the testimony of Sara Churchill and Mary Walcott alone. Margaret's
			accusations did not lead directly to her grandfather's death. She could have easily
			stuck to her story and avoided prison and the possibility of death. Her retraction of
			her accusation could not save her grandfather's life. The only thing that came out of
			her appeal to the magistrates was her own imprisonment and death sentence, both of which
			she accepted in order to live and die with the truth. Jacobs demonstrated at the age of
			seventeen a virtue that many people never acquire, moral integrity. Her story is a story
			of conscience and contrition which finds her alive in the end.</p>
<p>She remained in prison after her grandfather's death, awaiting her own fate. Her trial
			was temporarily postponed because of a boil on her head, which proved fortunate for her,
			because the witchcraft court was subsequently abolished, and she escaped the gallows. On
			January, 1693 she was brought before the newly established Superior Court of Judicature
			and found innocent.</p>

<p>"Accused Children in the Salem Witchcraft Crisis"</p>
<p>The witchcraft crisis in Essex County, Massachusetts in 1692 has long been known for its
			unusual list of accused witches. The high proportion of men accused of witchcraft in the
			crisis has been noted by historians for decades, as has the unusual preponderance of
			wealthy, influential citizens and upstanding church members.1
			There is one atypical group of accused, however, who have been largely overlooked.
			During the course of the crisis, at least eight children under the age of twelve were
			accused of witchcraft, and most were indicted. This examination of the eight cases of
			young children who were accused as witches will provide a vantage point from which to
			examine the dynamics of family and community that shaped the witchcraft crisis.</p>
<p>A study of the cases of these children reveals some notable common threads. First, in all
			of the cases, the only evidence offered against the children was spectral, and came from
			the "afflicted girls" of either Salem Village or Andover. In no case did anyone accuse a
			child of maleficium; every accuser was either an afflicted girl herself or someone
			acting on her behalf. All of the eight children also ultimately confessed to being
			witches while some, such as Sarah Carrier and Johanna Tyler, went as far as to offer
			descriptive confessions detailing their initiations into the service of the devil. Most
			notably however, every one of the eight had an accused witch for a mother. In each
			instance when a child under twelve was accused, his or her mother had been accused at
			some point during the previous weeks or months. Some, but not all, of the children's
			mothers had been convicted as well. The children themselves brought out this connection
			in their confessions: almost all professed that "thire mother mayd them witches."2 The cases of the children accused of witchcraft in Salem are
			thus inextricably linked to the witchcraft accusations of their mothers. A study of
			these unusual cases, in conjunction with an examination of the ways in which Puritan
			individuals were situated within the family and the religious sphere, can thus offer
			insights into the infamous events of 1692.</p>
<p>Before discussing the cases themselves, it is important to note that it is difficult to
			define a discrete category of "children" within the crisis. Whereas a study of men as
			witches is obviously quite clear-cut, it is less easy to say who was a child in the
			crisis of 1692, both for reasons of documentation and because contemporary notions of
			who was a "child" may have differed from modern ones. At times, it is simply difficult
			to determine how old individuals were during the trials; while a great deal of
			information can be gleaned from court records and other documents, or from each town's
			vital records, some people are hard to track. One young man from Manchester for example,
			Nicholas Frost, is listed in various places as having been born in either 1685, 1682, or
				1672.3 It is therefore possible that he fits into my
			category of children under twelve and should have been included in this study, but he
			also may have been as old as twenty. I therefore did not try to include him, as his age
			was simply too ambiguous.</p>
<p>Additionally, my definition of a "child" as someone under twelve is entirely artificial.
			To our modern sensibilities, people who are eleven years old or younger are children.
			However Abigail Johnson, aged eleven in 1692, is described as a "singlewoman" in the
			court records,4 suggesting that her "child" status can not be
			taken for granted. It is unclear whether her case is substantially different from those
			of the twelve- or thirteen-year-old young people who were accused of witchcraft and who
			were all, at the time, considered too young to testify in capital cases.5 I chose to view only those individuals who were under twelve as
			children in order to avoid an analysis of Puritan adolescent issues by focusing on very
			young children who were still clearly tied to their parents. However it may be defined,
			a significant group of young children were targeted as witches in 1692. Although the
			precise eight individuals whom I have chosen to include in this group may be debatable,
			the group nevertheless exists, and I believe the conclusions I can draw from this sample
			are valid.</p>
<p>A brief description of each case will serve to highlight their recurring themes and
			possible implications. Two of the best-documented cases of accused children were those
			of Sarah Carrier and Thomas Carrier Jr. of Andover, aged seven and ten
				respectively.6 The cases of the youngest Carrier children
			stand as a prime example of witchcraft as linked to family ties: their mother, Martha
			Carrier, was hanged as a witch a week after their August examinations, and their older
			brothers, Richard and Andrew, had confessed to witchcraft as well, albeit probably under
			torture. Both Sarah and Thomas also explicitly implicated their mother in their
			confessions. Thomas stated that "his Mother taught him witchcraft" and baptized him as a
			witch, while Sarah emphasized that their mother was, in fact, the primary agent acting
			on them: she said her mother baptized her, and that the devil or black man was not
				there.7 The cases of the young Carrier children, then, show
			clearly the ways in which children accused of witchcraft were linked directly to other
			family members, most closely to their mothers.</p>
<p>Sarah Carrier named others besides her mother who were present at her diabolical baptism,
			specifically "Aunt Toothaker and her cousin."8 Sarah and Thomas
			Jr's cousin Margaret Toothaker, aged ten and living in Billerica, was in fact another
			one of the accused children.9 Margaret is unusual in that not
			once in the Salem court documents is she mentioned by name. Margaret's married sister,
			Martha Emerson, was also an accused witch, and she and Margaret are sometimes hard to
			distinguish in the Salem records, as in a deposition against their father, an accuser
			makes reference to Roger Toothaker's "Daughter."10 However it
			seems clear that another Toothaker daughter besides Martha Emerson was implicated in the
			trials. One complaint, for example, lists "Toothaker" (not Emerson) as Roger Toothaker's
			accused daughter, and Elizabeth Johnson, another confessor, admits to seeing "goodwife
			toothaker &amp; two of Toothakers Children" at a witch meeting. While records of
			Margaret's examinations do not survive in the court records, her case is enlightening
			precisely because her existence is so inextricably tied to her family. She was referred
			to repeatedly as the daughter of her father or her mother, or even as a cousin, but
			never as an individual, thereby highlighting the tight linkages that existed within
			families. She was also unusual in that not only her mother, but her father as well was
			accused of witchcraft. Margaret Toothaker was the only small child with two parents who
			were accused witches.11</p>
<p>Another accused child with links to the Carrier family was Abigail Johnson, who was
			eleven years old and lived in Andover.12 While I was unable to
			determine whether the Carriers and the Johnsons were actually related in any way, it is
			clear that their families were strongly tied to one another, at the least as neighbors
			in Andover. For example, Abigail and her older brother Stephen were kept together with
			Sarah Carrier as the responsibility of three Andover men in place of going to the Salem
				jail.13 There are also numerous cross-references between
			Johnson and Carrier confessions; Thomas Carrier Jr. "Saw Betty Johnson in the Company"
			at a witch meeting, while Elizabeth Johnson Jr. stated that "Goody Carrier baptized her
			when she Baptized her Daughter Sarah."14</p>
<p>Abigail, like Margaret Toothaker and the Carrier children, came from a family of witches:
			both her mother Elizabeth Sr. and her sister Elizabeth Jr. were accused as well, and
			both confessed to witchcraft. Abigail's case is also an example of the theme of spectral
			torture of "afflicted girls" that pervades the accusations of all of the children.
			Martha Sprague and Abigail Martin, both teenagers who complained against seventeen and
			seven people respectively, accused Abigail Johnson of afflicting them.15</p>
<p>Closely related to the Johnson family were Abigail's cousins Dorothy Faulkner and Abigail
			Faulkner, Jr., two more children accused of witchcraft.16
			Dorothy, who was ten, and Abigail, aged eight, also lived in Andover. Their case returns
			to the theme of direct implication of mothers in children's confessions. Abigail
			Faulkner Sr. was an accused witch, and her daughters stated that "they were lead into
			that dreadfull sin of witchcraft by hir meanse." Also apparently led into witchcraft by
			Abigail Sr. was the last Andover child witch, Johanna Tyler, who was eleven in 1692.
			Although she directly implicated only Abigail Faulkner Sr. in her confession directly,
			stating that "Goode falkner Pirswaded her first," her mother Mary Tyler was also
			an accused witch.17</p>
<p>The one remaining child accused of witchcraft in 1692 was anomalous for several reasons.
			Dorcas Good was by far the youngest accused child at age "4 or 5," with the next
			youngest, Sarah Carrier, being "eight years old in November next." She was also the only
			child accused within Salem Village itself. In fact, she was essentially the only child
			accused outside of Andover. Margaret Toothaker lived in Billerica in 1692 but had lived
			in Andover previously and had relatives there,19 while the
			other six children all lived in Andover during the trials. The timing of her accusation
			was also anomalous; Dorcas was accused months before the Andover children. Dorcas, who
			was often referred to as "Dorothy" in the court records, was thus unusual among the
			children in her age, her place of residence, and in when she was accused. However these
			differences help to highlight the similarities that pervade all of the children's cases,
			which remain in spite of divergent external circumstances.</p>
<p>Dorcas Good, like the other children, was accused exclusively by afflicted girls: in her
			case, Ann Putnam, Mercy Lewis, and Mary Walcott. They accused her of spectral torment
			and not of maleficium, which was the pattern in the cases of the other children as well.
			Dorcas also confessed to being a witch, implicating her mother in her confession by
			saying that her mother "had three birds one black, one yellow &amp; that these birds
			hurt the Children and afflicted persons." Dorcas' mother, like the mothers of all of the
			other accused children, was also an accused witch; Sarah Good had been among the first
			to be accused and was one of the first to be hanged.20</p>
<p>One notable discontinuity between the different children's cases is that some of their
			mothers confessed to being witches while others denied the charges against them. Martha
			Carrier and Sarah Good maintained their innocence and were hanged, while Abigail
			Faulkner, Sr., Elizabeth Johnson, Sr., Mary Toothaker, and Mary Tyler all confessed to
			being witches.21 This factor seems to have had little effect
			on the plight of their children. During the Salem witchcraft crisis everyone who was
			accused was presumed guilty; magistrates asked leading questions, and those who insisted
			upon their innocence, at least during the earlier trials, were generally executed. In
			such an environment, a confession or the lack thereof did not greatly affect other
			people's perceptions of an individual as a witch. Children of confessed witches and
			those whose mothers insisted on their innocence alike were suspected and often accused
			of witchcraft.</p>
<p>Thus common themes appear in each of the cases of children accused of witchcraft. Sarah
			and Thomas Carrier, Margaret Toothaker, Abigail Johnson, Dorothy and Abigail Faulkner,
			Johanna Tyler, and Dorcas Good were all accused by afflicted girls, they all confessed
			to being witches, all had mothers who were believed to be witches, whether confessed or
			not, and many implicated their own mothers in their confessions.</p>
<p>An important point to bear in mind in examining the witchcraft cases of young children is
			that the notion of a child as a witch did not contradict Puritan belief. Particularly in
			the unusual case of Salem, witches and children alike were seen as easily influenced and
			potential or existing conduits for the devil. Whereas more typical witchcraft cases
			tended to include accusations of maleficium and therefore were targeted more at older
			individuals with negative reputations in the community, the focus in Salem was on
			spectral torment. A witch in Salem was thus primarily defined as one who had made a
			covenant with the devil. He or she was perceived as working with him to afflict other
			individuals, often with the intent of coercing them to make a diabolical covenant as
			well. Because the devil worked through people in this way, no prior experience or
			knowledge was necessary to make someone a witch; thus the notion of very young,
			uneducated children as potent witches was perfectly compatible with Puritan belief.
			Cotton Mather stated this directly, remarking, "Are they Young? Yet the Devil has been
			with them alreadyO They go astray as soon as they are born."22</p>
<p>Puritan children were also often viewed as religiously precocious by the adults around
			them. Children were surrounded by deep and pervasive religious belief from the time of
			their births. For this reason, adults assumed a fairly high level of theological
			understanding in children at a very young age. The modern historian Levin Schucking
			notes that "A child who, like little John Ruskin preached sermons about 'Dod' from a
			kitchen chair, was not only a frequent and typical phenomenon in the Puritan nursery but
			for nearly three centuries an extremely popular one."23
			Puritan children were thus considered in many ways to possess a good understanding of
			religious principles. Compounded with the little theological knowledge that was expected
			in a believable witch, this fact meant that the notion of children as witches was not at
			all incongruous in Puritan belief.</p>
<p>In fact, Puritan practice may have made children more likely than adults in some ways to
			actually believe that they were witches. The historian Judith Graham notes that "Puritan
			girls and boys grew up in a culture that relentlessly required them to confront their
			sinfulness, and to contemplate the possibility of being separated from the regenerate
			and condemned to the palpable horrors of hell."24 Puritan
			doctrine may thus have worked with childhood fears to convince children of their own
			inherent immorality and unworthiness. In such a context, it is hardly surprising that
			children as young as five or seven could convince themselves that their "sinfulness" had
			been translated into direct collaboration with the devil. The children's confessions
			from 1692 support this assumption.</p>
<p>More contemporary support comes from the Reverend Francis Dane, who was the father of
			Elizabeth Johnson Sr. and Abigail Faulkner Sr. He was thus intimately connected to the
			accused children and was unsurprisingly a critic of the trials.25 He made almost precisely this point about childhood fear, writing that in
			the case of "some Children we have cause to feare that dread has overcome them to accuse
			themselves in that they knew not."26 Even at the time of the
			trials, then, it was clear to some people that Puritan religious belief in general, and
			the witchcraft crisis in particular, may have been frightening the accused children into
			making confessions motivated primarily by fear. Children would have been likely,
			therefore, to confess to crimes that were already credible according to Puritan beliefs
			about both witchcraft and childhood.</p>
<p>The institution of the family was integral in Puritan society as well, occupying a
			central role in personal identity and spiritual well-being. Very visibly in the court
			documents, individuals are referred to through their linkages to others, as "wife of,"
			"daughter of" or "son of." This is most true of women and children, who were almost
			invariably linked to family members for their identities. Notably, while women were
			always mentioned in connection with their husbands, children were not always described
			in terms of their fathers. Rather, particularly in the cases of children accused of
			witchcraft, the children were frequently referred to as the daughters of their mothers,
			as in "Dorrithy good Sarah goods daughter" or "dorritye Forknor and Abigale Forknor
			children: to Abigall Farknor."27 This implicit alliance of
			children with their mothers has important implications for the way that conclusions were
			drawn and accusations made. As Richard Baxter wrote in 1673, "So it is an evident truth,
			that most of the mischiefs that now infest or seize upon mankind throughout the earth,
			consists in, or are caused by the disorders and ill-governedness of families."28 Family "governedness," in turn was the provenance of parents,
			particularly of mothers. Thus if children were identified with their accused-witch
			mothers, witchcraft would have been perceived as a family disorder.</p>
<p>Even more specifically, Schucking states that "Religion is for the Puritan family
			religion. Divine worship is, not incidentally but primarily, family worship."29 Thus not only were families tightly linked units in terms of
			general characteristics, but religious practices were interpreted as especially
			family-bound. The children's confessions in which they accused their mothers offer
			compelling support for this point. Sarah Carrier said, "My mother, she made me set my
			hand to a book," Thomas Carrier related how "his Mother baptized him in the ShawShin
			River," Dorcas Good confessed that her mother had given her a little snake as a
			familiar, and the Faulkner sisters stated that "thire mother apared and mayd them
				witches."30 Witchcraft was thus an inversion of Puritan
			doctrine, in which adherents followed the devil instead of God but in which the primary
			means of initiation was the same. Just as Puritans believed that religion must be
			learned and experienced within the family, so witchcraft was viewed as being transmitted
			through the family, and especially from a witch mother to her closely-connected
			children.</p>
<p>Witchcraft accusations of young children at Salem thus serve to highlight the strength
			and focuses of Puritan belief. They are therefore perfectly explicable in these terms.
			In many ways, it is possible to view the Puritan conception of witch mothers and
			children as the natural result as well as the inversion of the ideal Puritan mother and
			child relationship. Accused children, like ideal children, were religiously precocious,
			but they babbled confessions instead of sermons and covenanted with the devil instead of
			with God. Accused mothers, like ideal mothers, imparted their religion to their
			children, thereby ensuring one destiny or another for their children's souls. The thin
			line between ideal Puritanism and virulent witchcraft is exemplified in one statement
			from the confession of Sarah Carrier, in which she describes how her mother directly
			forced her into being a witch. Although Sarah never suggests that a minister performed
			her baptism, taken out of context, the sentence could almost refer to either diabolical
			or divine practice: "She said her mother baptized her, and her mother said when she
			baptized her, thou are mine for ever and ever and amen."31 The
			witchcraft accusations of children in the witchcraft crisis of 1692 can thus serve to
			exemplify Puritan notions of witchcraft, religion, and family relations. These ideas, in
			turn, can be applied not only to the cases of children, but to developing an
			understanding of the crisis as a whole.</p>

<h3>"The Geography and Genealogy of Gloucester Witchcraft"</h3>
<p>Written by Jedediah Drolet (copyright, 2005)</p>
<p>History 209, An Undergraduate Course, Cornell Univeristy</p>
<p>Spring Semester, 2003</p>
<p>Revised for presentation to the Berkshire Conference, June, 2005</p>
<p>Most scholarship on the Salem Witchcraft crisis has focused on Salem Village and to some
			extent on Salem Town. This is hardly surprising, since the crisis started in Salem
			Village and these two communities, along with nearby Andover, produced the vast majority
			of witchcraft accusations and trials. However, other towns in Essex County also
			experienced witchcraft allegations, some of which produced trials and even executions.
			One of these towns was Gloucester.</p>
<p>Gloucester in 1692 was still an isolated farming community, not yet the thriving port and
			fishing town it would soon become. It had survived a series of factional conflicts
			earlier in the seventeenth century and attained the kind of stable, harmonious
			equilibrium Puritans expected of their communities.1 And yet,
			this model New England town produced nine witchcraft accusations during the crisis, more
			than any other community except for Andover, Salem Village and Salem Town.2 There have been several explanations offered over the years,
			but none have been wholly satisfactory. This paper will offer a few tentative steps
			toward a new answer.</p>
<p>The Gloucester residents accused of witchcraft in 1692 fall neatly into a few discrete
			groups, due to the extremely scanty nature of the surviving records. The first group
			consisted of Margaret Prince and Elizabeth Dicer, who were accused by Ebenezer Babson on
			behalf of his mother, the widow Eleanor Babson, on September 3, 1692. This same Ebenezer
			Babson had been involved in the odd hysteria over phantom Indians and French soldiers
			that had gripped Gloucester the preceding summer, so there is much of interest in this
			case. However, a close look at this case would extend this paper far beyond a reasonable
			length, so I will not discuss it in detail, merely noting connections between it and the
			later case on which I focus.</p>
<p>The next Gloucesterwoman to be accused was Joan Penney. She was accused on September 13,
			1692 by one Zebulon Hill, a former resident of Gloucester who lived in Salem Town in
			1692. There are many intricacies of this case which have already been described in some
			detail by Carol Karlsen in The Devil in the Shape of a Woman, so I will not discuss this
			case either.</p>
<p>Phoebe Day, Mary Rowe and Rachel Vinson were probably the next women accused in
			Gloucester. There is no record of their accusation or examination extant, but their
			names were on a petition to the Governor and Council signed by a group of prisoners held
			at Ipswich jail sometime in early winter, asking to be set free on bail pending trial in
			the spring.3 Their accusation has traditionally been placed
			here in the chronology, between Joan Penney and the women accused of afflicting Mary
				Fitch.4 There is no extant contemporary evidence
			corroborating the traditional account, nor is there any other evidence of these women's
			cases to consider. There are, however, certain intriguing connections between these
			women and the next group, which will be explored in this paper.</p>
<p>The last group about which there are court records consists of Esther Elwell, Abigail
			Rowe and Rebecca Dike, a warrant for the arrest of whom was issued on November 3, 1692
			on account of accusations that they had afflicted one Mary Fitch made by her brother,
			nephew and son. This paper will focus on these women, their accusers, and the possible
			connections between them and the previously mentioned group of women in Ipswich
			jail.</p>
<p>Unlike the other cases involving Gloucester residents, the accusation of these three
			women followed a pattern unique to the events of 1692. In late October or early November
			Lieutenant James Stevens, a highly-regarded member of the Gloucester community, sent for
			the "afflicted girls" of Salem Village to find the culprit responsible for the
			bewitching of his sister Mrs. Mary Fitch, much as Joseph Ballard had done in Andover in
			July. The girls named Rebecca Dike, Esther Elwell and Abigail Rowe as the witches, and
			Stevens, his son William, and Mrs. Fitch's son Nathaniel Coit subsequently filed a
			complaint with the magistrates. A warrant for the three, the last arrest of the crisis,
			was issued November 5.5
		</p>
<p>Among the little surviving evidence in this case is the testimony of Mrs. Fitch's brother
			James Stevens about his sister feeling a woman sitting on her when he saw nothing, dated
			November 8.6 There is also a deposition of Betty Hubbard, one
			of the "afflicted girls" of Salem Village, against the three women with the same
				date.7 These scraps tell little about the subsequent
			experience of the three suspected witches, but it seems they were probably not indicted,
			since they would have been tried under the new courts convened in 1693 to replace the
			dissolved Court of Oyer and Terminer and there would be some record of their trials.</p>
<p>This James Stevens was an important figure in town. He was a deacon of the church and a
			lieutenant in the militia. His father William Stevens had been one of the early settlers
			of Gloucester and was a noted shipbuilder. James may have followed in the trade. He
			married Susannah Eveleth, daughter of Sylvester Eveleth, in 1656 and in 1658 received a
			grant from the town of land on Town Neck, near Trynall Cove. It is possible that he
			lived there, but there is no solid information on his place of residence. Eight of his
			eleven children were still living at the time of his death in 1697: William (who is also
			listed on the witchcraft accusation), Samuel, Ebenezer, David, Jonathan, Mary and
				Hannah.8 He probably inherited all of Eastern Point below
			the Great Pond from his father, who was apparently granted it by the town, since it was
			in the possession of his son Samuel Stevens in 1697.9 At his
			death in 1697 his estate totaled £239 19s.10
		</p>
<p>Mary Stevens, the daughter of William and sister of James, married John Coit in 1652 and
			had five children, one of whom, Nathaniel, is listed on the witchcraft complaint. She
			married John Fitch in 1667, after her husband's death. While John Coit was alive, the
			couple lived on the Neck of Houselots; the location of John Fitch's residence is
			frustratingly difficult to determine from the brief notices in the records. He received
			a grant at Kettle Cove in 1680 for his service in King Philip's War; there is no
			indication that he lived there, but even if he did he must have lived somewhere else
			prior to that.11 These people were all of relatively high
			status in the town, as indicated by the offices they held and the titles used to refer
			to them (particularly "Mistress" used of Mary Fitch). Mary Fitch's sickness in November
			1692, leading to her death, was the trigger for the accusation of witchcraft under
			discussion. </p>
<p>Esther12 Dutch, the daughter of Osman and Grace Dutch, was born
			around 1639 and married Samuel Elwell in 1658. Her parents lived at the Harbor at a
			place known as Dutch's Slough and were rather prominent in town affairs.13 Samuel Elwell's father Robert was also a distinguished
			citizen of the town. He lived at the Harbor at first, but most of his land was on
			Eastern Point, and he probably ended up living there.14 Samuel
			inherited his house and most of his land when he died in 1683. Prior to that Samuel had
			lived across the Harbor, near the Cut, in a house belonging to Robert that went to
			Samuel's son Samuel when Samuel (senior) inherited his father's house. The value of
			Robert Elwell's estate totaled £290 10s.15
		</p>
<p>Rebecca Dolliver was born around 1640, the daughter of Samuel Dolliver, who lived at
			Freshwater Cove. She married Richard Dike, who was about the same age, in 1667. They
			lived at Little River, where Richard had inherited land from his grandfather Walter
			Tybbot. Over the years his landholdings steadily grew through grants from the town and
			purchases from neighbors such as Joseph Eveleth, from whom he bought 13 acres in
				1669.16 This Joseph Eveleth was the son of Sylvester
			Eveleth and the brother of James Stevens's wife Susannah.17
		</p>
<p>Abigail Rowe was born in 1677 to Hugh and Mary Prince Rowe, who lived at Little Good
			Harbor and had large amounts of land there. The fact that she was only fifteen years old
			in 1692 shows immediately that there is more to this case than meets the eye. While it
			was certainly not unheard of for children to be accused of witchcraft, especially in the
			Salem hysteria, they were generally accused along with other family members as part of
			the cascade of accusations that swept through towns like Andover. Seeing a teenaged girl
			accused along with two adult women, neither of them close relatives, is quite
			unusual.</p>
<p>As it happens, Abigail Rowe was not, in fact, the only woman in her family accused of
			witchcraft, just the only one listed in this accusation. Her mother was one of the three
			women listed in the petition from Ipswich jail (as "the wife of Hugh Roe of Cape
				Anne"),18 and her grandmother was the aforementioned
			Margaret Prince, accused early on by Ebenezer Babson and also listed in the Ipswich
			petition. This is a strong indication of a link among these three accusations, as well
			as a clue to the date of accusation of the three women listed only in the petition; it
			would be unlikely for the daughter to be accused before her mother and grandmother,
			especially since she is not even listed in the petition herself. The link becomes
			stronger when the connections between the Rowe family and the Day and Vinson families
			are examined.</p>
<p>Hugh Rowe and his older brother John, along with their mother, received equal portions of
			their father John's estate of £205 16s. 10d. upon his death in 1662.19 Hugh received the land further from the house, toward Starknought Harbor,
			while John received the land closer to the house and their mother Brigit got the land in
			between. Hugh was also to share the east end of the house with his mother, and receive
			it for himself upon her death.20 Five years later Hugh and
			John entered into an agreement witnessed by Robert Elwell, who must have been a figure
			of mutual trust to John and Hugh.21 Another witness to a
			transaction of Hugh Rowe was Clement Coldum, who witnessed a sale of one-third of his
			property to James Gardner in 1668. In exchange for this land, Hugh received from Gardner
			his house and nine acres scattered around the Little Good Harbor/Eastern Point area,
			along with various other possessions. Gardner's land adjoined Hugh's, according to
			boundary landmarks mentioned in various land grants, including one from 1683 extending
			his land from the corner of Robert Elwell's marsh to the road to the Cape. So Elwell was
			also a neighbor.22
		</p>
<p>As for Coldum, he would later resurface in 1692 to give a deposition against Betty
			Hubbard, the seventeen-year-old girl who deposed against Esther Elwell, Rebecca Dike and
			Abigail Rowe, saying that when he was taking her home from meeting on May 29 she asked
			him to go faster because "she said the woods were full of Devils, &amp; said ther &amp;
			there they be, but I could se none." After he obediently sped up, she told him they had
			passed the devils and he could slow down. He then asked her if she was afraid of the
			Devil, and she said no, that "she could discourse with the Devil as well as with
				me."23 This raises the obvious question of what Coldum,
			who lived in either Gloucester or Lynn at the time, was doing in Salem in May of 1692,
			and why he was taking Betty Hubbard home, presumably to the house of William Griggs,
			where she was a servant. The most obvious answer is that he had been summoned for the
			grand jury for the Court of Oyer and Terminer established on May 27. No records of the
			names of jurymen survive, so there is no way to firmly establish if Coldum was one of
			them, but he had served on many juries for the Essex County Quarterly Courts, so it is
			entirely reasonable to suppose that he may have been summoned for this one.24
		</p>
<p>Betty Hubbard also had Gloucester connections; her master William Griggs lived there for
			several years and after the trials she herself settled down there and married. The
			influence her Gloucester connections may have had on her role in the accusations of
			Gloucester residents is still obscure but a ripe area for future study.</p>
<p>In 1685, Hugh Rowe received three parcels of land from his "father-in-law" William
				Vinson.25 Hugh's wife at the time was Mary, the daughter
			of Thomas and Margaret Prince, whom he had married in 1674.26
			However, he had married her six months after the death of his first wife, one Rachel
			Langton, whom he had married in 1667 and who had borne him three daughters.27 She was likely a widowed daughter of William Vinson by his
			first wife, Sarah, who had been accused of witchcraft in 1653. Even after her death, her
			father apparently continued to consider her widower his son-in-law.28
		</p>
<p>Thus Hugh and Mary Rowe lived near Robert Elwell, whose daughter-in-law was accused, and
			had a close relationship to William Vinson, whose wife was accused. Mary, who was
			accused herself, was also the daughter of Margaret Prince, who was accused. Thomas and
			Margaret Prince lived at the harbor, but they owned land all over, including Little
			River and Little Good Harbor. </p>
<p>The Rowes also had strong ties to the Day family. Hugh and Rachel Rowe's daughters Mary,
			Ruth and Rachel married, respectively, Ezekiel, Nathaniel and Samuel Day, sons of
			Anthony Day. These marriages took place between 1690 and 1692.29 Another of Anthony Day's sons, Timothy, married Phoebe Wilds in 1679. She
			was one of the women mentioned in the Ipswich petition.30
		</p>
<p>All of the Gloucesterwomen whose accusations are only known from the Ipswich petition
			were connected to the Rowe family. This provides clear evidence that there was a
			connection between their accusations and the accusation of November 3 against Esther
			Elwell, Rebecca Dike and Abigail Rowe. The fact that none of these women were listed in
			the petition, moreover, suggests that it was made before they were accused or at least
			before they had been put in jail. The petition is undated but mentions winter being "soe
			far come on that it can not be exspected that we should be tryed during this winter
			season," which could be reconciled with an autumn date.</p>
<p>A possible series of events, then, is as follows: the hysteria over spectral French
			soldiers and Indians during the summer, initiated by Ebenezer Babson, then in September
			the accusation of Margaret Prince and Elizabeth Dicer by Babson, based on complaints by
			his mother. Next, at some point in September or October, Rachel Vinson, Phoebe Day and
			Mary Rowe were accused, either together or separately, by someone in Gloucester,
			probably influenced by the torrents of accusations emerging in other Essex County towns.
			Since Margaret Prince had already been accused, it is likely that her daughter Mary Rowe
			was the focus of whatever accusation was made, and the other two were brought into it
			because of their connections to the Rowe family. The illness of someone in town could
			have been the catalyst for this accusation.</p>
<p>After that, Mary Fitch became ill. With hysteria over witchcraft growing, her family
			looked around for witches to blame, even sending for some of the Salem Village girls to
			uncover the culprits. The people they came up with, whether on their own or with the
			help of the afflicted girls, were tangentially connected to the women already in jail.
			Thus the accusation, listing three women not particularly connected to one another but
			part of the large social group that already had several more prominent members accused.
			However, by this time the trials were winding down and none of the accused women from
			Gloucester were tried.</p>
<p>This scenario fits with several pieces of evidence: the women accused early on, such as
			Margaret Prince and Elizabeth Dicer, were notorious for various reasons and thus more
			likely to arouse suspicions. Prince had a sharp tongue, and Dicer was once fined for
			calling Mrs. Hollingsworth of Salem a witch. The women in the Ipswich petition were
			somewhat less notorious, but had had their problems: Phoebe Day, whose maiden name was
			Wilds, was related to Sarah Wilds of Topsfield, who was hanged for witchcraft on July
			19, 1692,31 Mary Rowe was Margaret Prince's daughter, and
			Rachel Vinson was the widow of William Vinson, whose first wife had once been accused of
				witchcraft.32 The last group of accused women was even
			more distant from past suspicions: Abigail Rowe was probably accused because her mother
			and grandmother already had been, Esther Elwell's mother Ruth Dutch had been accused of
			witchcraft together with William Vinson's first wife, and Rebecca Dike seems to have had
			no clear connection to past suspicions at all, at least from extant records, but she
			lived near the Eveleths, in-laws of the Stevenses, who may have had their problems with
			her.</p>
<p>One final note about these accusations is that all the people involved were of high
			social and economic status. The Gloucester accusations involved no singling out of poor,
			marginal women, as was often true of witchcraft accusations (in Salem Village, for
			example). All of the estates of these families that were recorded were valued at more
			than 200 pounds. Furthermore, this is true of both the accusers and the victims. They
			all had comparatively large holdings of land and held many town offices. From a
			comparative perspective, this is perhaps the most striking aspect of the Gloucester
			accusations. The cases seem to have been based on fear and suspicion among the upper
			class against a backdrop of paranoia throughout the county.</p>

				that association with Quakers was a reason for witchcraft allegations, but she

				Lieutenant James Stevens and the actual victim, with Mary Stevens Norwood, the
				sister of Lieutenant William Stevens (and daughter of James) who was being courted
				by the Quaker Francis Norwood Jr. around this time. She makes her argument in Commerce and Culture,107-108, 111-112; compare the warrant

<h3>John Alden</h3>
<p>A member of the Boston elite, Captain John Alden was accused on May
28th, 1692 but avoided further proceedings on April 25, 1693
when he escaped from jail and fled to New York where several
high-profile witchcraft defendants were welcomed and protected. Although the
accusers knew him only by name, his profitable connections to Maine and
involvement with the Indian Wars which orphaned several of the accusers
likely contributed to the accusations against him.</p>

<h3>
			John Alden
		</h3>
<p>Written by Virginia Leavell, 2003</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Fall Semester 2003</p>
<p>Prominent sea Captain and merchant John Alden was in his mid-sixties when he was accused
			of witchcraft on May 28th, 1692. Son of John and Priscilla Alden of Plymouth Colony, he
			was a member of Boston's First Church, led by the Rev. Samuel Willard. As part of the
			Boston elite, the accusation that he was allied with the devil and afflicting young
			girls was significant in that it affirmed the seriousness of the accusations, and it
			showed that immunity was not granted to anyone, regardless of class or rank. Indeed,
			"One of the Salem Justices [Bartholomew Gedney] was pleased to tell Mr. Alden, (when
			upon his examination) that truly he had been acquainted with him these many years; and
			had always accounted him a good man; but indeed now he should be obliged to change his
			opinion."</p>
<p> While the justices recognized and knew Alden when he appeared in court for his hearing,
			the afflicted girls initially could not identify him. John Alden's account of his
			preliminary hearing states that an young female "accuser had a Man standing at her back
			to hold her up; he stooped down to her Ear, then she cried out, Aldin, Aldin afflicted
			her; one of the Magistrates asked her if she had ever seen Aldin, she answered no, he
			asked her how she knew it was Aldin ? She said, the Man told her so." If the girls
			didn't even know Alden, then why would they persecute him? </p>
<p>The answer, as historian Mary Beth Norton points out in In the Devil's
				Snare, may lie in Alden's connections with the Indians of Maine. As Captain of
			the official colonial sloop, Mary, Alden made over a dozen official government trips up
			and down the New England coast. While many of his endeavors involved providing support
			for the resistance to the French and Indians, Alden was also widely thought to be
			continuing to trade with the Wabanaki Indians who had attacked English selltements in
			Maine. There were pervasive rumors that he was also providing supplies to the French
			enemy Castine. His marriage to Elizabeth Phillips also strengthened his lucrative ties
			with Maine, with her inheritance of profitable sawmills in Saco, Maine from her father
			William Phillips. For the young female accusers, several of whom had painful ties to
			Maine where the Indian Wars had orphaned them, a man who may have profited from the
			Indians presented a logical target.</p>
<p> The accusers' knowledge of Alden's involvement with Maine and the Indians was affirmed
			during the hearing when an accuser cried out, "there stands Aldin , a bold fellow with
			his Hat on before the Judges, he sells Powder and Shot to the Indians and French, and
			lies with the Indian Squaes, and has Indian Papooses." Thus it was also suspected that
			Alden's relationship with the Indians extended beyond commercial trade. This was not the
			first time gossip was given substantial weight during the witchcraft trials.</p>
<p>In mid-September 1692, Alden escaped from the Boston jail and fled to New York where
			several high-profile suspects had escaped from the Salem crisis were welcomed and
			protected. He returned from New York by Dec 22 and posted bail by Dec 31. By the time he
			appeared in court on April 25, the hangings had stopped, and his case was "discharged by
			proclamation" to the chagrin of the chief magistrate of the witchcraft court William
			Stoughton. </p>

<h3>Thomas Putnam</h3>
<p>Although Thomas Putnam's role in initiating legal proceedings has been generally recognized as important to the escalation of the witchcraft crisis in Salem in 1692, the immense influence Putnam had on the shape of the trials has not been widely recognized.  Putnam was the father of Ann Putnam Jr., the most prolific accuser in the entire proceedings. Putnam’s importance is generally seen in the fact that he, along with other adults, gave his daughter’s accusations legal weight in first seeking warrants against the accused witches in February, 1692.    Through his work in writing down the depositions of many of the "afflicted" girls in Salem village and his letters of encouragement to the judges, Putnam was one of the major advocates of the trials and sought to exert influence on the proceedings as one of the most prosperous residents and influential church members in Salem Village.</p>

<h3>
			Thomas Putnam
		</h3>
<p>Written by Joseph Fore</p>
<p>RELG 415: Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, Univeristy of Virginia</p>
<p>Fall Semester, 2006</p>
<p>Thomas Putnam was a third generation member of Salem Village. He had many relatives in
			the area and they collectively owned a substantial amount of land in Salem Village and
			Essex County. Putnam was a Sergeant in the local militia and had fought in King
			Phillip's War (1675-1678) against native Indians and their French allies on the
			northeastern frontier. He was married to Ann Putnam Sr. (maiden name Carr), who came
			from a wealthy Essex County family.1</p>
<p>Sometime in January of 1691/1692 Ann Jr. began having fits along with other girls in
			Salem Village. By the end of February of that year, the girls claimed that the source of
			their affliction was witchcraft and made specific accusations against Sarah Good, Sarah
			Osborne and Tituba, an Indian slave of the Reverend Samuel Parris. Because the girls
			were not of legal age to make accusations, Putnam along with three other prominent men
			in Salem village filed official compalints on their behalf and sought warrants against
			the suspected witches on February 29, 1692. Immediately, the three women were arrested
			on suspicion of witchcraft, which was a capital offense, and were taken into
				custody.2</p>
<p>In April 21, 1692, with dozens of accused already in jail, Putnam wrote a letter to John
			Hawthorne and Jonathan Corwin, two of the judges of the examining magistrates in Salem
			who would later be appointed to the special court of Oyer and Terminer to try the
			accused witches. In that letter Putnam gave the honored judges a "most humble and hearty
			thanks" for the work they had done to root out evil in Salem. Putnam remarked that the
			judges had taken "great care and pains" to assist the people of Salem during this time
			of crisis. Putnam claimed that the people of Salem could never repay the judges for
			their remarkable actions. He assured the judges that "therefore a full reward will be
			given you of the Lord God of Israel, whose cause and interest you have espoused." Here
			Putnam was giving the legal proceedings against the witches a decidedly theological
			grounding. He was emphasizing the apocalyptic nature of the struggle in Salem. The Devil
			was attempting to spread evil in Salem, through his pact with the witches. In order to
			defeat Satan, good men like the judges were required to do God's work by seeking out
			those who had made a pact with the Devil. Putnam reminded the judges that their work for
			God's cause against Satan would only "add to [their] crown of glory in the day of the
			Lord Jesus." Here Putnam was making the argument that the judges would receive praise
			and reward when Jesus came for a second time and resurrected the souls of the
			faithful.</p>
<p>Yet despite the hard work of the judges, there remained work to be done. In his letter,
			Putnam wrote that he believed it his duty to inform them of a "high and dreadful" truth,
			of a "of a wheel within a wheel, at which [their] ears do tingle." The day before, on
			April 20th, his daughter had accused the Reverend George Burroughs of tormenting her.
			Burroughs was to be accused of being the ringleader of the witches in Salem. Putnam was
			referring to this greater conspiracy in this part of the letter. Putnam asked the judges
			to continue to pray for the community and offer their help and prayed to "almighty God
			continually to prepare [them]" for the work ahead. He hoped the judges would be a "a
			terror to evil-doers and a praise to them that do well" and offered his assistance to
			them in any way he might be able.3</p>
<p>In April, Putnam sent a second letter to Judge Samuel Sewall. In that letter he wrote
			that his daughter "was grievously tormented by witches, threatening that she should be
			pressed to death, before Giles Cory." Here Putnam was simultaneously arguing that
			witches were still at large in the community and that they were greatly angered by the
			trial of their fellow witches, like Giles Cory. Putnam claimed that his daughter had
			been visited by the specter of a person who had been pressed to death by Giles Cory and
			that that person had claimed that God desired Giles Cory to die in the same way that he
			had died. Here Putnam was arguing that God supported Cory's immediate death by pressing.
			Putnam then reminded Judge Sewall that some seventeen years past a man who lived with
			Giles Cory had "bruised to death." Putnam implies that Cory had to pay a large bribe to
			avoid prosecution in this case. Once again, in this letter, we see Putnam supporting the
			judges' actions and giving their work a theological basis, arguing that God supported
			their work.4</p>
<p>The question of Putnam's motives in furthering the trials has been taken up by many. In
			Miller's The Crucible, the Putnams worried that several of their children might have
			been killed by witchcraft. In reality, the Putnams had only lost one child, a girl named
			Sarah who died six weeks after birth in 1689.5 Ann Jr.
			accused John Willard of killing baby Sarah through witchcraft. Worry over the death of
			their baby daughter two years prior and the possibility that it may have been the result
			of witchcraft provides one explanation for the zeal that Putnam showed in attempting to
			provie evidence against so many for the crime of witchcraft.</p>
<p>A recent handwriting analysis of the depositions of the afflicted girls has shown that
			some 122 of them were written by Thomas Putnam. While it cannot be known to what degree
			the accusations made in those depositions were influenced by Putnam it is clear that
			Putnam had the opportunity to shape the words of the young accusers as he saw fit.
			Further, the similarity in language across these depositions suggests that some of the
			language might be that of Thomas Putnam rather than that of the afflicted girls
				themselves.6 In the depositions taken by Putnam, the
			afflicted often claim to be "grievously afflicted" or "grievously tormented" and "beleve
			in my heart" that so-and-so is a witch. The accused are often referred to as "dreadful
			witches or wizards" in the depositions taken by Putnam. The frequency with which these
			phrases can be found in the depositions written by Putnam furthers the theory that they
			might have been more strongly influenced by Putnam that was previously recognized. Taken
			in conjunction with Putnam's letters to the judges and his efforts to secure warrants
			against many of the suspects, this new evidence further demonstrates the remarkable
			influence Putnam had on the shape and progression of the trials.</p>

<h3>Dr. William Griggs</h3>
<p>Dr. William Griggs of Salem Village, though not referred to by name in the court documents, is generally accepted by historians as the doctor who made the diagnosis that the afflictions of the girls in Salem village were caused by “an evil hand,” not by natural causes.  His diagnosis triggered a sequence of events that began with the making of a witch cake and led to hundreds of accusations of witchcraft.</p>

<h3>
			Dr. William Griggs
		</h3>
<p>Written by Beckie Dashiell</p>
<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>
<p>Fall Semester 2006</p>
<p>Dr. William Griggs is often cited in connection with the witchcraft hysteria that plagued
			Salem Village in 1692 as the man who made the diagnosis which led to accusations of
			witchcraft. As the only physician in the village, he was called upon to examine the
			strange symptoms of the afflicted girls. His famous diagnosis as cited by both John Hale
			in A Modest Enquiry and Charles Upham in Salem Witchcraft – that the girls were “under
			an Evil Hand” – left the residents of Salem to assume witchcraft. Mary Beth Norton
			claims that Griggs was a supporter of Reverend Parris. So while the first afflictions
			occurred in Parris’s own home, it seems likely he would turn to his friend and church
			member Griggs for a consultation. Griggs and his wife are listed on the pro-Parris
			petition of 1695, and Griggs’s support never wavered, even after the witch trials. Dr.
			Anthony Patton also points to a close relationship between Thomas Putnam Jr. and Griggs,
			in which Griggs sided with Thomas Putnam in a probate dispute. Griggs supported Putnam
			heirs who tried to invalidate the will of Mary Veren Putnam (Putnam’s step-mother) by
			testifying to the incompetence of Mary Veren at the time she wrote her will. As court
			documents show, Putnam was a supporter of the "afflicted" girls in Salem village, the
			most prominent being his own daughter, Ann Putnam, Jr. Griggs’s own great-niece,
			Elizabeth Hubbard, was a friend of Ann Putnam, Jr. and among the most active of the
			young female accusers.</p>
<p>Dr. Griggs’s educational background is unclear. Given the context of the times in early
			colonial New England, it is unlikely that he received any formal medical training or
			that he was aware of the advances in medicine in Europe. As Patton indicates, women were
			responsible for primary care during sickness. Only when an illness was unusual or
			persistent were doctors called upon to examine patients. In cases when the physician was
			unable to explain the cause of the illness, usually a sudden and violent kind of
			sickness, doctors and family members sometimes suspected witchcraft. And to the New
			England Puritans in 1692, witchcraft was a valid diagnosis. The Puritans believed God
			punished all sinners with illness or calamity. In this sense, according to Norman
			Gevitz, ministers and physicians played complementary roles in tending to the sick.
			Ministers tended to spiritual needs while physicians tended to physical ones. Yet when a
			physical condition persisted, and the patient could not account for any spiritual
			shortcomings, he or she would look outwards for a cause, hence the validation of
			witchcraft.</p>
<p>As Gevitz points out, physicians were the “principal professional arbiters for
			determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease,” and hence they
			wielded an incredible amount of power in determining the prevalence of witchcraft in a
			given town or village. The judges in Salem consulted the English Reverend Richard
			Bernard’s Guide to the Grand-Jury Men, written in 1627, in which he addressed the
			prosecution of witches. While the book’s main goal was to caution jurymen to exercise
			scrutiny when dealing with cases of witchcraft, Norton indicates that Bernard supported
			relying on doctors for the “initial diagnosis of diabolic activity.” Knowing that the
			Salem judges read this work, it is obvious why the doctor’s word was so weighty and
			irrefutable, and why Griggs’s pronouncement was the next key step in creating the
			paranoia in Salem.</p>
<p>The sequence of events leading up to and following Griggs’s diagnosis is important to
			trace. The first fits occurred in mid-January, yet no accusations were made until the
			end of February. According to John Hale’s contemporary book, A Modest Enquiry Into the
			Nature of Witchcraft, when the girls in Parris’s household first exhibited their
			afflictions, Parris called in ministers and magistrates, the “Worthy Gentle-men of
			Salem,” for consultation. They concluded the afflictions were “preternatural,” and
			advised prayer. Griggs was also called in but spent several weeks observing the girls
			before he made his diagnosis. Hale’s book also gives us the only account of the girls’
			afflictions before they were diagnosed: “These Children were bitten and pinched by
			invisible agents; their arms, necks, and backs turned this way and that way… so as it
			was impossible for them to do of themselves, and beyond the power of any Epileptick
			Fits, or natural Disease to effect.” Doctors had enough medical information to know that
			the girls did not suffer from epilepsy or disease. Surely, these afflictions must have
			been unsettling. Hale’s book also gives us the account of Griggs’s diagnosis: the girls
			were “sadly Afflicted of they knew not what Distempers; and [Parris] made his
			application to Physitians, yet still they grew worse: And at length one Physitian gave
			his opinion, that they were under an Evil Hand. This the Neighbours quickly took up, and
			concluded they were bewitched.” Assuming, as most historians do, that the “physitian”
			here is Griggs, we see the immediate and painful influence of Griggs’s words as the
			neighbors took up his diagnosis to mean witchcraft. After Griggs’s diagnosis, Mary
			Sibley, a neighbor, told Parris’s slave John Indian to make a witch cake “to find out
			the Witch,” where upon the “afflicted” immediately began to make accusations.</p>
<p>Yet, according to Gevitz, doctors were often pressured to diagnose diabolic activity, as
			a means to validate the suspicions of the patient’s family and friends. We can’t know
			whether Griggs was pressured to make his diagnosis that the girls were “under an Evil
			Hand” on account of his friendships with Parris and Thomas Putnam Jr., or whether he
			simply was baffled and could find no natural cause for the girls’ afflictions. Either
			way, as a church member he must have been under pressure to make a diagnosis, and we can
			see how his pronouncement of witchcraft was taken both definitively and seriously in the
			village.</p>
<p>Situating Griggs among his contemporaries in and around Salem, we can use the Salem
			witchcraft court records to examine the role of physicians in Salem around 1692. In a
			deposition against Rebecca Nurse, Nathanial and Hannah Ingersoll recount that Benjamin
			Holton “died a most violent death with dreadfull fitts and the Doctor that was with him
			said he could not tell what his distemper was.” Here, we see the doctor’s inability to
			make a diagnosis. Yet, Holton’s death occurred in 1689, so in claiming his death as
			proof of Rebecca Nurse’s malice, Ingersoll was using a doctor’s inability to diagnose in
			the past as proof of witchcraft in the present. In the deposition of Samuel Shattock
			against Mary Parker, Shattock recalls his “Child . . . to have bin under an ill hand for
			Severall years before: was taken in a Strange &amp; unuseall maner as if his vitalls
			would have broak out his breast boane … So Strange a maner that the Docter &amp; others
			did beleive he was bewitched.” Again, we see a past event being taken as proof of
			witchcraft, and a “Doctor &amp; others” are baffled so that they “believe he was
			bewitched.” In a deposition against John Willard, villagers “sent to the french Doctor
			but hee sent word againe that it was not a naturall Cause but absolutly witchcraft to
			his Judgment.” Here we see another doctor who made the same diagnosis as Griggs. And in
			the deposition of William Brown against Susannah Martin, Brown claimed that his wife was
			ill and he “porcured Docter fuller &amp; Crosby to com to her for her releas but thay
			did both say that her distemper was supernatural &amp; no siknes of body but that some
			evil person had bewiched her.” These references to doctors in the court documents show
			that other physicians experienced the same difficulties: when they couldn’t find a
			natural cause for an illness, they would diagnose witchcraft. And in some cases, Salem
			villagers used the doctor’s inability to diagnose as proof of witchcraft.</p>
<p>Griggs’s place in history is well-established. He appears in Arthur Miller’s 1954 play
				The Crucible by name only, though he is brought onscreen in
			Miller’s movie adaptation. In the text of the play he heightens the hysteria when he
			sends a verbal message to Reverend Parris “that he cannot discover no medicine for [the
			girls’ afflictions] in his books.” His message also tells Parris, “you might look to
			unnatural things for the cause of it.” In the play, we see how these comments support
			Parris’s convictions that witches are among the villagers of Salem. Charles Upham’s
			account of the witch trials also refers to Dr. Griggs and to the diagnoses of doctors
			who “When their remedies were baffled, and their skill at fault, the patient was said to
			be ‘under an evil hand.’” Upham blasts Griggs and the doctors in general for “so far as
			the medical profession is concerned they bear a full share of responsibility for the
			proceedings.” In giving doctors the “full share of responsibility,” Upham, as a minister
			himself, perhaps tries to shift blame from the clergy to the doctors, though we know
			ministers were also consulted and concluded that the symptoms were “preternatural.”</p>
<p>Upham's scathing 19th century indictment of Griggs also fails to account for the
			pressures he might have faced, as well as the popular belief in witchcraft. None of the
			Puritans in 17th Century New England doubted the presences of witches; it was perhaps
			more a question of knowing how and when to identify them. Against this background,
			Griggs’s diagnosis was fairly normal, as he was certainly baffled by the girls’
			afflictions. As a man of limited medical training and a church member, he was also
			responding to the fear created by the idea of Satan attacking the village church,
			something alluded to in the Rev. Parris’s sermons. As there exists no personal
			explanation by Griggs himself, we cannot definitively account for his diagnosis. As a
			church member whose friends and their children were caught up in the afflictions, even
			his own grad niece seventeen year-old Elizabeth Hubbard, Griggs would have been troubled
			by the fact that prayer was not working to cure the girls’ “fits,” as they were called.
			But his diagnosis does not warrant a “full share” of blame. Rather, Griggs shares
			responsibility with the ministers and magistrates as one of the professionals involved
			in advancing the Salem witch trials.</p>
