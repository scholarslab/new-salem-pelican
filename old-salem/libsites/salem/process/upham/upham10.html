					<h3>Digitizing the Upham Map</h3>
					<h4> J. Quality and Usefulness of Control Points</h4>
					<p>With control points established, we now began the process of registration and
						rectification of the Upham map image. <b>Registration</b> refers to the
						process of linking an image to real geographic coordinates with GIS data.
							<b>Rectification</b> refers to the transformation process in which a
						registered image is &quot;distorted&quot; to orient it to true north. Both
						steps are necessary to produce georeferenced points from Upham's map.
						Registration is a trial-and-error process, an art, rather than a science. It
						essentially involves significant human judgment to account for uncertainty,
						and thus introduces more error. </p>
					<p>Registration and rectification were performed in ArcInfo 7.2.1, which
						requires at least three widely dispersed control points. We have sixteen,
						but of unequal value and quality. </p>
					<p>Several of these points, and particularly those on the northeastern,
						northwestern, and southwestern corners, represented large area features:
						ponds, hills, or islands within hills. It is difficult to match a point
						(e.g., a set of precise geographic coordinates) with a large area feature
						that could contain many such points. Imprecise matches of these points could
						result in a poor overall transformation. </p>
					<p>Furthermore, at the outset, we could not be sure of the quality of Upham's
						points. If Upham incorrectly drew the distance between two sites we used as
						control points, linking his drawing to our data would involve an erroneous
						match. </p>
