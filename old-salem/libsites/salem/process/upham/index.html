					<h3>Digitizing the Upham Map</h3>
					<h4>A. About the Upham Map </h4>
					<p>W.P. Upham, brother to author Charles, researched and drew the map. In his
						notes to the volume, Charles Upham included some details about how land
						grants were located and drawn, but is largely silent about how his brother
						located the dwellings of the major actors in the Salem narrative:</p>
					<blockquote> The map, based upon various local maps and the Coast-Survey chart,
						is the result of much personal exploration and perambulation on the ground.
						It may claim to be a very exact representation of many of the original
						grants and farms. The locality of these houses, mills, and bridges, in 1692,
						is given in some cases precisely, and in all with near approximation. The
						task has been a difficult one. An original plot of Governor Endicott's
						Ipswich River grant, No. III., is in the State House, and one of the
						Swinnerton grant, No. XIX., in the Salem town-books. Neither of them,
						however, affords elements by which to establish its exact location. A plot
						of the Townsend Bishop grant, No. XX., as its boundaries were finally
						determined, is in the State House, and another of the same in the
						court-files of the county. This gives one fixed and known point, Hadlock's
						bridge, from which, following the lines by points of compass and distances,
						s indicated on the plot and described in the Colonial Records, all the sides
						of the grant are laid out with accuracy, and its place on the map determined
						with absolute certainty. A very perfect and scientifically executed plan of
						a part of the boundary between Salem and Reading in 1666 is in the State
						House; of which an exact tracing was kindly furnished by Mr. H.J. Coolidge,
						of the Secretary of State's office. It gives two of the sides of the
						Governor Bellingham grant, No. IV., in such a manner as to afford the means
						of projecting it with entire certainty, and fixing its locality. There are
						no other plots of original or early grants or farms on this territory; but,
						starting from the Bishop and Bellingham grants thus laid out in their
						respective places, by a collation of deeds of conveyance and partition on
						record, with the aid of portions of the primitive stone-walls still
						remaining, and measurements resting on permanent objects, the entire region
						has been reduced to a demarkation comprehending the whole area. The
						locations of then-existing roads have been obtained from the returns of
						laying-out committees, and other evidence in the records and files. The
						construction of the map, in all its details, is the result of the researches
						and labors of W. P. Upham. <p align="right" class="captions"> From &quot;Map
