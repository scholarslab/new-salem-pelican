            many persons, in several families, of this little Village, to be
            grievously vexed, &amp; tortured in body, &amp; to be deeply
            tempted, to the endangering of the destruction of their souls;
            &amp; all these amazing feats (well known to many of us) to be done
            by Witchcraft, &amp; Diabolical operations. It is also well known
            that when these calamities, first began, which was in my own
            family, the affliction was several weeks before such Hellish
            operations, as Witchcraft was suspected. Nay it never broke forth
            to any considerable light, untill Diabolical means was used by the
            making of a Cake by my Indian man, who had his direction from this
            our sister Mary Sibly : Since wch Apparitions have been plenty,
            &amp; exceeding much mischief hath followed. But by this means (it
            seems) the Devil hath been raised amongst us, &amp; his Rage is
            vehement &amp; terrible, &amp; when he shall be silenc'd the Lord
            only knows. But now that this our sister should be instrumental to
            such distress, is a great grief to myself, and our godly Honoured
            &amp; Reverend neighbours, who have had the knowledge of it.
            Nevertheless, I do truly hope, &amp; believe, that this our sister
            doth truly fear the Lord, &amp; am well satisfied from her, that
            what she did, she did it ignorantly, from what she had heard of
            this nature from other ignorant, or worse persons. Yet we are in
            duty bound, to protest against such actions, as being indeed a
            going to the Devil, for help against Devil, we having no such
            directions from Nature, or Gods word, it must therefore be, &amp;
            is, accounted by godly Protestants, who write or speak of such
            matters as Diabolical, &amp; therefore calls this our sister to
            deep humiliation for what she has done, &amp; all of us to be
