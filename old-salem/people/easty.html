<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Considering the assumption that witchcraft was hereditary, Mary
(Towne) Easty was certain to be accused of witchcraft after her
sister, Rebecca (Towne) Nurse, was condemned for her unwavering
appeal of innocence. Mary Easty was not a member of Salem Town or
Village, but a resident of Topsfield, a settlement just north of
the Village. Animosity had festered between members of Salem
Village and Topsfield since 1639 when the General Court of
Massachusetts granted Salem permission to expand northward in the
direction of the Ipswich River, but then only four years later the
same court authorized inhabitants of another Village, Ipswich, to
found a settlement there. As land became scarcer, quarrels
regarding boundaries between the settlement to become known as
Topsfield and Salem went on for a century. The Putnams of Salem
Village embodied this battle in their quarrels with the Nurse
family, Mary Easty's brother-in-law. According to Boyer and
Nissenbaum in <i>Salem Possessed</i>, considering the bitterness
between these families, it can be seen as no coincidence that the
three Towne sisters, Rebecca Nurse, Sarah Cloyce and Mary Easty,
were all daughters and wives of Topsfield men eventually to be
persecuted by Putnam women in 1692 on behalf of Putnam men.<br />
<br />
More interesting than the accusations against Easty is her
experience during the trials. She was accused on April 21, examined
on the 22nd, and imprisoned after denying her guilt. During her
examination, Magistrate John Hathorne aggressively questioned
Easty, or more accurately, tried to lead her to a confession by the
following line of questioning:<br />
<br />
"How can you say you know nothing when you see these tormented
[girls], &amp; accuse you that you know nothing?" "Would you have
me accuse myself?"<br />
"Yes if you be guilty."<br />
"Sir, I never complied but prayed against [the devil] all my
dayes... I will say it, if it was my last time, I am clear of this
sin." (SWPI 120)<br />
<br />
In a surprising moment, Hathorne, clearly affected by the
convincing manner with which Easty spoke, turned to the accusers
and asked, "Are you certain this is the woman?" This question acted
as a symbol for the accusers to release their full energy into
tormented fits. Hathorne was now convinced and imprisoned Easty.
The girls, however, seemed not to be fully convinced of their own
accusations. Perhaps due to pressure from community around Easty,
all of the accusers, except Mercy Lewis, began to back off their
claims and Easty was released from jail on May 18.<br />
<br />
The details of what happened next provide undeniable clues about
the power of the accusers and the impossibility of conducting a
fair juridical process. After Easty's release, Mercy Lewis fell
into violent fits and appeared to be approaching death. Mercy Lewis
later explained that Easty was tormenting her, and "said [Easty]
would kill [Lewis] before midnight because she did not cleare hir
so as the Rest did." (Salem Witchcraft Papers, I: 124) Mary
Walcott, Abigail Williams and Ann Putnam were brought to her
bedside in an effort to discover who was tormenting Mercy. Along
the path to the Mercy's house, Ann and Abigail explained that they
saw Easty's specter tormenting Mercy, strongly suggesting a
collaboration effort had already taken place before Mercy began her
torments. Frances Hill in <i>A Delusion of Satan</i> calls this
episode a propaganda scheme to show doubting Villagers the dire
consequences of freeing witches from jail. Mercy and four others
cried out against Easty on May 20. Mercy's fits did not cease until
Easty was back in prison in irons demonstrating the effective power
of the accusers.<br />
<br />
While Easty remained in jail awaiting her September 9 trial, she
and her sister, Sarah Cloyce, composed a petition to the
magistrates in which they asked, in essence, for a fair trial. They
complained that they were "neither able to plead our owne cause,
nor is councell allowed." They suggested that the judges ought to
serve as their counsel and that they be allowed persons to testify
on their behalf. Easty hoped her good reputation in Topsfield and
the words of her minister might aid her case in Salem, a town of
strangers. Lastly, the sisters asked that the testimony of accusers
and other "witches" be dismissed considering it was predominantly
spectral evidence that lacked legality. (Salem Witchcraft Papers,
I: 303) The sisters hoped that the judges would be forced to weigh
solid character testimony against ambiguous spectral evidence. The
petition did not change the outcome of Easty's trial, for she was
condemned to hang on September 17th. But together with her second
petition, Easty had forced the court to consider its flaws.<br />
<br />
Easty's second petition was written not as a last attempt to save
her own life but as a plea that "no more innocent blood may be
shed." (SWP I :304) She concedes saying that the court had the best
of intentions, but only more innocent deaths would occur if the
court continued its practices, for she like many others could not
"belie [their] own soul." She proposes two strategies for the court
in to use when determining witchcraft: First, she asks that the
accusers be kept apart to see if under such circumstances they
would all tell the same experiences. If they were able to give
similar credible accounts of their spectral experiences then any
doubt would be removed as to the guilt or innocence of the person
on trial. This proposal brings to mind Thomas Brattle's observation
in his famous <i>Letter</i> of October 8, 1692 that the accusers,
when not claiming to be attacked by specters, were otherwise in
good health. Easty was obviously not the only skeptic of the
accusers' spectral torments. Secondly, Easty proposed that all
confessing witches be brought to trial as well as those confessing
innocence. Rosenthal writes in <i>A Salem Story</i> that in an
atmosphere of rising doubt, "for the court to ignore Easty's
challenge would be to acknowledge to the critics that the
proceedings were fatally flawed - that the hunt was not really for
witches after all but for validating the court."<br />
<br />
Easty was hanged on September 22, 1692. Her demeanor at Gallows
Hill is documented by Calef: "when she took her last farewell of
her husband, children and friends, was, as is reported by them
present, as serious, religious, distinct, and affectionate as could
well be exprest, drawing tears from the eyes of almost all
present." Easty challenged the court to no personal avail, but she
exposed the weakness of the court for the benefit of others.<br />
