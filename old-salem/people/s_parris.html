<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Samuel Parris was born in London, England in 1653. He is known
to history for his crucial role in the events of Salem Village in
1692. His unstable financial background, his harsh preaching, and
self-seeking purposes in Salem Village created social conflict and
an insecure family situation. The "affliction" of his middle
daughter, Betty Parris, and his live-in niece, Abigail Williams,
started the accusations of innocent persons in the Massachusetts
Bay Colony. In addition to his family's affliction, he was
personally involved in the witch-hunt. The role the Rev. Samuel
Parris played in the trials contributed to the conviction of 19
innocent victims in 1692.</p>
<p>Parris moved with his family from England to Barbados in the
1650's, where his father and uncle owned successful sugar
plantations. His father sent him to Harvard College in Boston to
begin his education. Upon his father's death, he left Harvard
before graduating to attend to his newly inherited plantation in
Barbados. There he worked as a middleman and merchant in
Bridgetown. In 1680 he moved back to Boston with two slaves, John
Indian and Tituba, and married Elizabeth Eldridge, a fellow member
of Boston's First Church. Together they had three children, Thomas,
in 1681, Elizabeth (Betty) thirteen months later, and Susanna five
years later.</p>
<p>After his father's death, Parris inherited his father's land in
Barbados, while his older brother inherited the family land in
England and Ireland. The supposed bitterness of Parris over the
land distribution started Samuel on a life long quest for security.
Land ownership became important to Parris. The need to ensure his
families safety led to his accusations of others for witchcraft for
the afflictions in his community. Yet in a statement to his
congregation, Parris chose to take no responsibility for the
"fortune-telling" actions of his own daughter and niece that led to
the suspicions of witch-craft in the community. Instead, he focused
on the "diabolical" activity of Mary Sibley, a neighbor, who had
told John Indian to make a "witchcake" from the girls' urine and
feed it to a dog. This procedure was supposed to reveal the names
of the witches attacking Betty Parris, Abby Williams, and Mary
Sibley's own niece, Mary Walcott. Thus, Parris shifted focus from
his family's involvement to Sibley for starting the witch-hunt,
pointing to her action as the cause: "since which apparitions had
been plenty,and exceeding much mischief hath followed."</p>
<p>Parris enjoyed modest prosperity as a merchant in Boston. He
then began his ministerial career by speaking as a substitute
pastor. Finally, he got his own church in Salem Village in July
1689. With the help of his supported in the Village, he tried to
take over ownership of the parsonage, generally held by the church,
not the minister. In addition, he raised his salary from 35 pounds
to 40 pounds. The newly elected Village Committee, however, became
dissatisfied with Parris and refused payment of his salary and
denied firewood in 1691-1692. This conflict contributed to his
lifelong quest for "temporal security".</p>
<p>Salem village was divided, and he sided with the farmers trying
to gain independence from merchant dominated Salem Town. He left
notes for 52 sermons between 1689 and 1694 in which he mingled his
"personal failures and the villagers' frustrations and transformed
them into a cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan". What
separates Salem Village from the other New England communities lies
within the preaching of Parris. He preached on the forces that
threatened both family and the church. His words gave rise to the
suspicion that everyone could be an agent of the devil. Parris'
concern for his church and self resulted in stimulating concern
about the presence of Satan in Salem. His sermons affected
everyone, even down to his own household.</p>
<p>In 1691, Betty and Abigail Williams began to play with fortune
telling to find their future husbands occupations. Charles Upham
later attributed the teaching of fortune telling in the household
to Tituba, Rev. Parris's slave. But more recent scholarship
questions this claim, as historical sources give no indication that
Tituba played any role in the girls' fortune telling episode.
Nevertheless, the girls became "afflicted" and Parris sought to
rectify the situation. Dr. William Griggs pronounced their
affliction to be the result of witchcraft. Parris began by
organizing prayer meetings and days of fasting to help alleviate
Betty's symptoms, which only became worse with time. He turned to
Tituba, and according to Tituba's court testimony, he "beat her"
into confessing the afflictions and naming other witches. He felt
the weight of his family's affliction and sought to alleviate their
pain.</p>
<p>On February 29, Parris and several other men in town, including
Thomas Putnam, whose daughter Ann was also afflicted, his brother
Edward, Joseph Hutchinson, and Thomas Preston, a son-in-law of
Rebecca Nurse and Francis Nurse, went to the courts to file
complaints. The complaints read that Tituba, Sarah Goode, and Sarah
Osborn all performed witch-craft against the girls, Betty Parris,
Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam, and Elizabeth Hubbard. This started
the trials, only to cease after the deaths of 19 individuals.</p>
<p>Parris fueled the witch-hunt in many ways. From the pulpit,
Parris spread the idea of witchcraft and demonic activity to the
townspeople. From his sermons, the townspeople turned towards one
another and the accusations added up as they considered Parris's
sermons on the Devil. He was one of ten members of the clergy
involved in the trials. To protect his position in the church and
his family, Parris continued to make accusations and believe the
socially marginal actors that were apparently afflicted by these
"witches". To remove blame from his household, Parris sent his
daughter Betty away to live with Salem merchant Stephen Sewell.
There, she did not experience the ailments any longer. Parris did
allowed Abigail Williams to stay in his household and continue to
make accusations and contributing to the trials, though.</p>
<p>Parris's own role in the trials consists in serving as an
occasional court recorder and in testifying against several of the
accused "witches". As a recorder, he made special note of the
"noyses by the afflicted &amp; many speakers". He points to Martha
Cory, Susanna Martin, Rebecca Nurse, John Proctor, Tituba, and
Willard, accusing them of witchcraft. His name appears in over 22
different court cases during the trials. He escorted Abigail
Williams to the court and brought forth many of the accusations on
behalf of the afflicted. He justified his participation in the
witch-hunt as an effort to drive Satan out of Salem. His part in
the events, though, crucially affected the outcome of many lives.
The extent to which his family was involved, according to Gragg,
"it is not surprising that Parris accepted the evidence from the
afflicted and the confessors uncritically". After all, his daughter
and niece were afflicted, two of his slaves confessed to
witch-craft and accused others, and his wife also became a target
of witchcraft. This, on top of securing his position within the
church, led to the involvement of Parris.</p>
<p>At the end of the episode, Parris deflects responsibility from
himself to anyone he can identify. The town split along two
factions, pro-Parris and anti-Parris. The issue of conflict stemmed
from the ownership of the parsonage and later his support for the
trials once they were over. He blames the divided village on Satan.
Parris sought to reconcile the church in several ways, while
maintaining that the Devil has influenced his opponents. He begins
by asking the congregation for forgiveness of Mary Sibley, who
first made the witch cake that his own daughter knew about and
encouraged. Finally, in November 1694, Parris publicly admits that
his own household tampered with witchcraft and "he himself had been
as gullible as Sual at Endor". He also preached a sermon of apology
called the "Meditations for Peace". Here ends Parris's role in
witch craft phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to the biography by Gragg, Parris' most consistent
concern was that to gain a sense of security. This included
personal assurance of salvation, gaining a sense of community with
fellow Christians, enhanced status in society, and the need achieve
financial security for himself and his family. His most sustained
effort in his life was the drive to diminish material uncertainty.
These reasons help explain his behavior in 1692, his drive to
protect himself and his family and ensure his position in society
that would allow him to achieve all of those goals.</p>
<p>The accusers included dissenters from the trials, families of
the accused or the executed witches. Among the leaders were Daniel
Andrews, the Nurses and the Porters, as evident in the anti-Parris
petitions. He fought back against the petitions to remove him from
the pulpit. Although Parris's opponents organized their opposition,
approximately three-fourths of those that signed a petition favored
Parris. After a struggle to get his salary money and seize the
parsonage, he realized that he would not succeed. The minority that
opposed him forced the strong willed minister to leave the village
despite his backing within the church.</p>
<p>Parris's quest for security is also evident in the rest of his
life. He remained pastor in Salem but still unpaid by the
committee. The village still blamed Parris for his role in the
trials and blamed him for the deaths of many innocent people. John
Tarbell, the Rebecca Nurse family, Daniel Andrews (one of the
accused), and Joseph Putnam, petitioned committees to remove Parris
as minister, naming him the "instrument of our miseries". The
Parris opponents cited it on the grounds that he was unfit to be a
minister after working with the Devil in 1692. In return for the
parsonage deed, the village paid Parris, and he left to begin his
new life in elsewhere in 1697.</p>
<p>The rest of Parris's life consisted of preaching and teaching
around New England. He first moved to Stowe, and then to Concord
and Sudbury, where his wife had inherited a farm. In 1720, Samuel
Parris died. His legacy remains in his role during the Salem Witch
Trials, a "Machiavellian in pursuit of ascendancy over the
villagers." Gragg maintains that Parris played a decisive role but
cannot be blamed for the witch-hunt. Nevertheless, his sermons
contributed to the atmosphere that made the hunt possible, and he
assisted the goals of trials in every possible way through his own
witchcraft accusations and the writing of court records.</p>
