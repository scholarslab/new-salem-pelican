<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Increase Mather was born on June 21, 1639 to Richard and
Katherine Mather. He and four of his five brothers would follow
Richard's call to guide the morality and spirituality of their
fellow man, even as the family ventured with other Puritans to New
England in the seventeenth century. There the Mathers settled, as
Richard took up his ministry in Dorchester just south of
Boston.</p>
<p>Increase graduated from Harvard College in 1656, an institution
to which he would return as its President. His son, Cotton Mather
was born into the third generation of Puritan Mather ministers, and
after following in father's footsteps by studying at Harvard,
Cotton would join his father as a leader in the Boston religious
establishment.</p>
<p>In February 1674, Increase Mather delivered a sermon, entitled
"The Day of Trouble is Near", the first of many great speeches to
the faithful that would make him an influential Puritan leader in
Boston and across the growing Massachusetts Bay Colony. By
1680-1681, Increase Mather had "established himself as the
conservative champion of the New England church." His predominant
role in Puritan society would call him across the ocean, as
turbulent events in England led to the revocation of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony's charter. Between 1688 and 1692, Increase
Mather was in England advocating on behalf of the colony.</p>
<p>Mather returned to New England on May 14, 1692 with not simply a
new charter, but also a new Governor, Sir William Phips. Increase
Mather played a crucial role in securing Phips' appointment by the
Crown, and therefore the Governor was indebted to him for his
position.</p>
<p>When Mather and Phips arrived in Boston, events in Salem Village
had already begun to swirl beyond the confines of that small
community. The jails were beginning to fill with the accused
witches, and interim Governor Bradstreet had kept courts from
sitting in trial. The new Governor, empowered by a new charter,
looked to clear the judicial backlog and established the special
Court of Oyer and Terminer to "hear and determine" the witchcraft
cases. On May 27, 1692 the Court was established, and Bridget
Bishop was the first to be executed on Gallows Hill in Salem
exactly two weeks later on June 10.</p>
<p>Governor Phips, apparently surprised at the speed and force
which his actions had begun to unleash, looked to Increase Mather
and other notable Boston ministers for guidance. Increase signed
onto "The Return of Several Ministers," written by his son, Cotton
Mather, which put the Boston ministers on record urging caution in
the use of spectral evidence in the Salem court. Pre-occupied with
preparations for an expedition to fight Indian forces in Maine,
Phips did not pay sufficient attention to the mounting number of
arrests and executions ordered by the Salem court, before he left
Boston for Maine in mid-August 1692. With Phips went Increase
Mather's highest patron in civil government and any hopes he might
have had of restraining the court in Salem.</p>
<p>As June stretched into July, the pace of arrests, examinations,
and imprisonments only quickened leading to the execution of five
women on July 19. On July 31, Increase delivered a sermon at Simon
Willard's Third Church in Boston in which he posed the question to
the congregation: "O what makes the difference between the devils
in hell and the angels of heaven?" Mather answered that the quality
of holiness distinguished an angel in heaven from the devils below,
and in doing so he "focused responsibility on the people of New
England at large, and yet looked to individuals for the means to
solve the problem. It encouraged the individual believer to attend
to the state of his or her own soul regardless of what might be
happening in the world." (Peterson, 93). The impact of such words
from a Boston pulpit on views of the witchcraft problem is
indirect, but clear nonetheless. Mather advised the congregation
that they should focus their attention on their own shortcomings
and not those that they saw in their neighbors and friends. Still,
this was not a clear message to halt the trials, and they continued
unabated in Salem.</p>
<p>Increase Mather attended only one trial in Salem, that of George
Burroughs, Jr., and he seems to have fully agreed with the result.
Bernard Rosenthal in his <i>Salem Story</i> focuses attention on
the seeming contradiction between Increase Mather's overall
opposition to the Court's methods and his support for the same
methods in the case of Mr. Burroughs. Rosenthal writes that,
"Burroughs, as a dissenting minister, offered so powerful a symbol
of lost Puritan power that such moderate and influential ministers
as Increase and Cotton Mather lost their way in confronting his
case." Contradictions such as this continue to haunt comments on
Mather by scholars of the period.</p>
<p>By late September 1692, the witchcraft trials had truly reached
an hysterical pitch. Nineteen had been hanged, and Giles Cory had
been tortured to death for refusing to enter a plea. Scores of
people languished in the jails awaiting trial on the charges
against them.</p>
<p>In <i>Cases of Conscience</i> Increase Mather forcefully related
his distrust of spectral evidence to convict witches. He argued
that it would be better that ten witches go free than the blood of
a single innocent be shed. One Mather biographer wrote that, "No
zeal to stamp out crimes ever drove him from his belief that,
whatever the fate of the guilty, the innocent must never be in
peril." His strong words of disapproval for spectral evidence so
prominently used by the Court of Oyer and Terminer ended the trials
after the directive from Governor Phips at the end of October,
recently returned from his expedition in Maine.</p>
<p><i>Cases of Conscience,</i> however, is not without its flaws,
the chief one being Mather's attempt to absolve the judges of Salem
of any wrongdoing and to praise them for their work. Bernard
Rosenthal writes that, "Indeed, when the witch trials ended, he
damned the prosecution and justified the prosecutors." Perry
Miller, more forcefully, writes that "Without the postscript,
<i>Cases of Conscience</i> would be a bold stroke; with it, the
book is a miserable species of double-talk." Kenneth Murdock offers
a more balanced approach when he writes of Mather's postscript,
"Less could hardly be said in fairness. More approval of the trials
Mather never expressed."</p>
<p>Increase Mather has been criticized for his delay in putting his
considerable moral authority against the trials, but it would seem
that from his endorsement of "The Return of the Ministers" through
his own <i>Cases of Conscience,</i> Mather was continually seeking
to lend caution to the hysteria without undermining the tenuous
framework of the Puritan government in Boston and Salem. Others
have criticized Mather for his seeming duplicity, in excoriating
the trials in general but supporting that of Burroughs or in
deriding the conduct of the Court but praising its overseers. It is
important to note, as many have done, that Increase Mather very
much believed in the evils and dangers of witchcraft and had no
doubt that if the handiwork of the devil was proven, a Puritan
society should "suffer no witch to live." Mather may very well have
thought George Burroughs was a witch and been satisfied to hear of
his hanging in August 1692. He likely admired to some degree the
tenacity with which the Court of Oyer and Terminer took to the task
of defending the covenanted community of the Massachusetts Bay from
the devil.</p>
<p>Increase Mather, however, understood that innocent blood was
being shed, and that the Salem court ran rampant without concern
for the advice of the clerical guides, an unprecedented development
in the Puritan Colony. In the witchcraft trials that grew out of
the supposed afflictions of young girls in Salem Village, Mather
may also have seen the symptoms of a fundamentally changing Puritan
world. He was caught in the middle of it, along with the rest of
New England, and no doubt agreed with his friend Thomas Brattle
that, "ages will not wear off that reproach and those stains which
these things will leave behind them upon our land."</p>
