<blockquote><font color="purple">Ferris:</font>
<blockquote><b>I understand that you had ancestors in Salem Village
and that they were involved in the witch trials. What was your
family connection and did it inspire you to study these
trials?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray:</font>
<blockquote>It was just a few years ago that I actually paid any
attention to that family connection. I'm an Africanist and work
generally on a different continent, so it wasn't something I was
looking into either in a scholarly way or as family history until I
went to pick up my daughter from college in Boston. My wife and I
decided we would make a side trip to Danvers, which is the old
Salem Village, and look up where my ancestors lived. I found some
still-standing houses, which was amazing. One is a
seventeenth-century house. I thought, "My goodness, there are
actual buildings standing there that my ancestors lived in." So I
began to look at the published documents a little bit more. There
is an index and you can look up everyone's name, or almost
everyone's name.<br />
<br />
I noted that my family's names were always listed mainly as
defenders, which is something I hadn't heard about. You hear about
accusers and the accused and the ministers and judges, but there
were a number of villagers who were trying to save those who were
accused by signing petitions, testimonials, on their behalf.
Unfortunately, that had absolutely no effect, and some risk for the
people doing it.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>That is amazing. You have obviously done a lot of
detective work for the Salem project. What have you
found?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>I'm working with a colleague. My job is the more
technological side, giving access to this material. Bernie
Rosenthal, who is in the English Department at SUNY-Binghamton, is
the editor-in-chief of a new transcription of the court documents.
There are about 850 court documents. The Puritans documented
everything they did, both good and bad. This really tells the story
of the people. You hear the voices of the accusers and the voices
of the accused, the judges, the ministers, even occasionally some
of the attendants. The most valuable kind of document is, in fact,
not the arrest warrants and the depositions so much as the actual
courtroom interaction where you hear those confrontations.<br />
<br />
As I was looking in the archives in Boston, particularly at the
Boston Public Library, I ran across some of these transcripts,
which apparently had been overlooked by earlier scholars and
transcribers. Just encountering those and transcribing them for the
first time was pretty exciting. I think every historian is eager to
find something new in a territory that has already been well worked
over.</blockquote>

<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>By putting the Salem Village court documents online,
you are making them accessible to people all over the world. Who is
using your site?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>Looking at the web statistics at the moment, it is
educational institutions and individual members of the general
public. It is about half educational and half the general public
that has an interest and is looking for resource
material.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>What makes a web archive useful for
students?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>We have a few search mechanisms. For example, a
previous transcription of the court documents has been available
since 1977, and although they're flawed and based on work during
the WPA period of the Great Depression, they are nevertheless
pretty good, and we have those online. For example, if you type in
the word "witch," you will get every occurrence in what are
approximately three volumes of documents. And for the first time, a
high school student can write a paper on the subject of the concept
of the witch in the trials, or the concept of the devil, or the
concept of evil as it was used by judges and accusers and the
accused. You can get a good handle on this conceptual terrain and
what was going on that was so inflammatory at that
time.</blockquote>

<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>How has the Internet changed your work as a
historian?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>There are several things going on. We are using the
Internet to provide access to materials that have been difficult
for our students, let alone the general public, to work with. A
colleague of mine in the history department has taught a course on
the Salem witch trials only once in the twenty years that he has
been here, even though he is a Puritan historian, because you can't
really get these primary sources into the students' hands for them
to get excited about unless you have every student owning three
volumes of court documents, which are in fact out of print. So it
has been difficult to teach this subject except by secondary
sources. What's exciting for historians is to put primary source
materials in the hands of the students so they can participate in
the kind of scholarship that scholars do. You can then teach the
craft of scholarship, whether it is history or any other
subject.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>One benefit of the Internet is that you can combine
text and images in new ways. How do the interactive maps on your
website help understand who is being accused and who is doing the
accusing?</b></blockquote>

<hr width="300" /></center>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>That is another exciting feature -- the ability to put
text and graphic images together. Sometimes those images are
contemporary with the text and other times they are decades or a
century or two later. That is one of the goals of the NEH-funded
project: to create a history of the images so you can understand
how in different periods the images themselves are functioning as
interpretations.<br />
<br />
What we have done, too, is provide maps to help give a graphic
representation of historical context. It is hard to envision what a
village is like on the ground, where people are living. If you
click on households on the map you'll see all the households spring
into view. It shows a rather large population of about five hundred
people living in the households.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>I see that, too.</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>If you want to know something about the accused slave
who is named Tituba -- the red dot on the "Salem Village" map --
she was one of the first accused, and you click on the red dot, the
screen opens up with a list of the members of the household and the
biography and some documents and images.

<hr width="300" />
The Reverend Parris is the minister of the village meetinghouse.
And it shows several accusers in that family, as a matter of fact.
Elizabeth Parris, with her birthday there, you see she's only ten
years old. And then her cousin -- and we will have genealogies
attached to this -- is Abigail Williams. She is the niece of Samuel
Parris and the cousin of Elizabeth. She is an accuser, too.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of thing I like. You go to images and click and go
to the illustration of Tituba's encounter with the famous Puritan
clergyman Cotton Mather. So here you have the fair-skinned,
fair-haired young Cotton Mather encountering this image of an
elderly Native American woman with her basket full of herbs,
scowling and looking very mean. If you go to Tituba in image number
two, you see something quite different. This is a 1997 image from a
juvenile book. Tituba is no longer an elderly Native American. She
is a young African American, with the girls fascinated with her
divination, which uses an egg white in a glass.<br />
<br />
These images through time relate to both oral tradition and actual
text traditions. We can link texts with these and the surrounding
context of how the American imagination has dealt with the episode
across time, including racial, ethnic, and gender
perceptions.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>There were all sorts of explanations for what
happened in Salem. Some said that independent women who lived
alone, like widows and midwives, were accused of witchcraft because
their neighbors coveted their property. What do you think caused
the whole incident?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>We will always be attracted to the theory that weights
the cause in one direction. It is like the McCarthy trials, which
Arthur Miller wrote the play The Crucible to reflect upon. There is
a nexus of factors that allowed this to happen. You have neighbors
with grudges. You have ministers who were eager to seek a revival
of faith and religious authority. You have judges, particularly the
chief justice, who had a political interest -- he had his eyes on
the governorship. You have petty disputes among families living in
the villages. You have a new charter for the Massachusetts Bay
Colony, and a little uncertainty about how to proceed. A lot of
features together make what is absolutely a unique event.<br />
<br />
This number of accusations never occurred before; the situation
became out of control. It ran all up and down the social ladder,
which was unusual. Why such a broad range and such a broad
scope?<br />
<br />
It wasn't just the village. Twenty-seven people in Salem Village
were accused. In the village of Andover, there were forty-seven. In
the town of Salem, there were seven. Up as far as Wells, Maine, and
down to Boston, more than 150 people were accused. So you have a
large area of Massachusetts Bay that is involved, too, making any
one explanation a little too simplistic for a complex
phenomenon.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>Your website builds on research that was done in the
late thirties and funded by the WPA. How did the WPA project come
about?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>I'm not sure how that came about. It was funded by the
WPA program, but it was a clerk of courts in Essex County that
oversaw the actual transcription and the collection together of the
documents so they could be transcribed, a wonderful recovery
because some of these documents, the originals, have now been lost
since that 1938 transcription. They existed in typescript, and in
1977 they were put out in published form. That created a watershed
of scholarship.<br />
<br />
The web presentation will extend the possibility of more
scholarship, perhaps more fine-grained, through the search engines
and through the placing of texts, images, demographic, and
genealogical data together on this site. We will put in those
firsthand eyewitness accounts. There also were six books published,
and we are putting those online in original page images -- there
were sometimes only three or four copies -- and digital texts that
can be searched.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>How does your project add to the WPA
transcriptions?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>In almost any of the transcriptions you look at, there
are a few mistakes, many of them minor. But as the editors begin
working on it, they have found some major whole lines and sentences
left out, and wrong dates, which change the meaning of the
document. We will be putting on updates over a period of two or
three years as the international team of editors works on the new
transcriptions, and we are putting up many facsimiles, scanned, of
the originals so that a viewer can look at the original document
and see some of the issues involved as the editors work on
them.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>When you do a search on the Internet for words like
witch and Salem, you get a list of sites dealing with everything
from pagan religions to Sabrina, Teen Witch. How does your site
debunk or correct this mass of information?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>That was one of the motivations. Initially, I wanted to
provide resource material for teaching a seminar for religious
studies majors. As I made a check on the web, I discovered there is
everything under the sun out there, and very little is reliable.
This gives depth historically.<br />
<br />
That is what the University of Virginia Electronic Text Center is
dedicated to, putting texts online and maintaining them. This
archival site won't go away.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>That's wonderful.</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>It will be maintained for scholars in perpetuity. That
is just part of the new direction of digital libraries, digital
research.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>Tituba, the first person accused of witchcraft in
Salem, was a slave from Barbados. She confessed that she was a
witch, and several books telling her story have come out recently.
Is it true that Tituba was a Native American and not born in
Barbados?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>There is not a whole lot of evidence to help us. She is
said to have come from Barbados with the Reverend Samuel Parris,
who was the owner of a sugar plantation, which failed, and he sold
it. It is said that the two slaves he brought with him, Tituba and
her husband John, were from Barbados, but they were always referred
to in the court documents as Indians. Consistently, there are
numerous documents specifying her name and following it with the
word "Indian." The Puritans differentiated between African
Americans, and they were slaves, and those that they called Indian,
who I assume meant Native American. But a little bit beyond that,
you can't go. They never called her black and never called her
African, which is the term they use for several of the slaves who
appear in the witchcraft documents.<br />
<br />
One of the issues, on the other hand, is simple to resolve: What
kind of witchcraft did she know about, or what kind of divination
was she teaching, if she taught the girls in the Parris household?
Was she teaching something that we can now identify as, say,
culturally African or Caribbean? The answer to that is quite
simple: No. If she were involved at all in teaching the method of
divination, what she was teaching was European, the egg white in
the glass of water. As the egg white sinks into the water and
swirls around and you look in the glass, it's kind of like a moving
Rorschach, and that is a European technique. Riding on a pole in
the air, which she confesses to, is also a European idea. And
seeing witches in the woods in some kind of ritual context is also
a European idea. So all of the documents give us information about
her, and what she was doing and her knowledge of anything related
to witchcraft or divination indicates it was European and not West
African. As an Africanist, that's pretty clear to me.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>How much did race and class have to do with who was
accused of witchcraft?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>Not much. Apart from Tituba and two or three others --
Mary Black -- there weren't too many slaves mentioned in the
documents, and very few of them were accused. The accusations
generally fall along lines of previous social conflict between
families who are in either positions of power and are contesting
each other or are contesting property, as you mentioned, or they're
contesting relationships they have in the church or other
relationships.<br />

<hr width="300" />
Going up the social ladder, you have another group of people
accused: Those are people who are beginning to object to the
trials, even the governor's wife. John Alden, son of two rather
famous figures, Priscilla and John Alden, becomes caught up in the
accusations because he's an Indian fighter. The rumors are that he
also had Indian women and some sort of relationship with them;
those rumors get translated into accusations. So it spreads around
the whole social ranking system pretty quickly.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>What was the common definition of witchcraft in the
seventeenth century?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>That's easy: a covenant with the devil. It was the
mirror image of the covenant the Puritan was to make with God.
Becoming a member of the Church was something you did as an adult.
You signed a book of membership after being examined by your
minister in the presence of the congregation and by affirming your
kind of experiential, spiritual encounters with God, with Christian
teachings in your life.<br />
<br />
The reverse was true, then, with the devil, throughout the
documents. The devil would present a book, and you were to sign it.
This was an act of not just religious aversion, but since it was a
theocracy, a political aversion, so it was an act of betrayal. For
that, if you were guilty, you were beyond the pale. The condemned
witches were not buried in cemeteries. They were outcast. They were
executed outside the town, beyond the borders of the community,
because they were agents of a subversive force.</blockquote>

<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>In Europe, between the fourteenth and eighteenth
centuries, more than one hundred thousand people were accused of
witchcraft and many were put to death. How does the Salem
witch-hunt compare with witch-hunts in Europe?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>I wish I was more of a European historian.<br />
<br />
In New England, the accusations were very local, only two or three
people, and the judges and the clergy were most concerned to
control the accusations and to dampen down this avenue of social
redress. Even in the prelude to Salem, some girls in Boston were
going through physical gyrations and verbal abuse, and accusing
people, and Cotton Mather was most concerned that they did not
begin to attract others to make similar accusations. There was a
general attitude of damping down accusations when they occurred and
not acting on them so that it would inflame others.<br />
<br />
In Europe, you have larger numbers accused, and it is much more
tied up with state and church-political institutions -- until
Salem. In Salem, there were more accused than ever had been in the
history of New England, and even more executed. That is what has
attracted scholars, what happened in Salem. The accusations started
at the end of February 1692, and before they were stopped in
November, there were about 150 people in the jails.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>Arthur Miller created a vivid image of
seventeenth-century Salem in his play <i>The Crucible</i>. The
witch-hunt is now an icon in the public imagination. Will your
website disillusion people only acquainted with Arthur Miller's
version of the story?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>There is a website that I've come across that is pretty
good at dealing with the differences between his play and
historical events in Salem. His play is very effective, obviously,
and he has taken literary license with history, which I think is
fine to make a unified, effective dramatic piece.<br />
<br />
I think what you get in the documents is as riveting as in Miller's
play when you read the voices of the accusers and the accused. They
claim their innocence in a dramatic form and assert themselves
almost against both church and state. They are thinking: Before God
I am innocent, and something has gone off the rails here. The
church and the state are going in the wrong direction.<br />
<br />
The dramatic voice of those courtroom scenes comes through as
strongly as in the documents as in Miller's slightly adapted
version. In Salem today re-enactors perform segments of the court
trials, lifted right from the actual words of the
documents.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>The Salem witch trials have fascinated Americans for
centuries, and there is a wealth of literature inspired by the
historic events. Why do you think this period of history inspired
such an outpouring of creative work?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>It is hard to reconcile -- our view of America as a
land of freedom to which people came who were fleeing persecution
and to discover that, at least in Massachusetts Bay, those very
people set up a system which could eventually become a system of
persecution of the kind they fled. It stands as an aberration of
what we think of as our founding principles. And it is a gripping
story of heroic victims -- mainly women -- and vengeful
persecutors, both male and female, young and old.<br />
<br />
I never knew of the interest in Arthur Miller's play, to the Salem
events, until I happened to talk with friends who live in Europe,
where the play is regularly performed and resonates there, too, in
a way that relates to their experience in the former Soviet
Republic, for example, in Latvia.</blockquote>
<font color="purple">Ferris</font>:
<blockquote><b>How would you say that the witch-hunt is still
relevant for us today, four hundred years later?</b></blockquote>
<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>It is not that history repeats itself exactly, but you
see a microcosm of a moment of crisis in which people are making
decisions as to where they're going to stand in this vital moment.
That is very instructive for any time.</blockquote>

Charlottesville and the University of Virginia that have that nexus

<font color="red">Ray</font>:
<blockquote>Somebody said that there is "something in the water in
Charlottesville," where we've taken technology and tried to use its
tools to extend and to enliven the educational mission. I think it
has to do with the commitment at various levels of the university
from the top down, the president's office, from alumni donors who
are excited, from institutions. IBM started contributing, and Xerox
Foundation did. They were looking for institutions who might be
interested in technology. A member of the engineering school said
to IBM, "Why don't you put some technological machinery in the
humanities area? Let's see what will happen when you do that." Ed
Ayers saw the potential and his example then led others to take a
look. We have developed programs for the classroom, a teaching and
technology initiative. We have developed programs for faculty
research projects at the Institute for Advanced Technology in the
Humanities, which is supporting the Salem project. It has caught on
through a few good examples and wonderful institutional support.
This technology is not a way of necessarily teaching more with
less, as some might fear in other schools, but teaching better and
exciting your faculty about the possibilities. That is why it has
caught on, I think. It has excited us about teaching and research.
Ed and the rest of us are as excited about how we can apply it to
our classrooms and our students as we are in advancing purely
scholarly goals for the community of scholars. Our work is aimed
both at research as well as application in the teaching
mission.</blockquote>

database that will enable them to query the database and ask
questions and get tables and answers in response. We are quite
excited. When you put in genealogy and demographics and social
ranking together with text documents and images and search engines,
we don't know what we will come up with.</blockquote>

In Tituba's Encounter with Cotton Mather in the woods of Salem, by
J. W. Ehninger, Tituba is depicted as an elderly American Indian
woman. In the children's book illustration by Robert Gantt Steele,
she is a young, energetic African American girl. In Maryse Conde's
<i>I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem</i>, excerpted below and
translated with NEH support by Richard Philcox, she is portrayed as
an African American woman. Tituba's actual ethnic origins remain a
mystery to this day.
<blockquote><i>Then Goodwife Parris told me what was going on in
the village. "I can only compare it to a sickness that first of all
is thought to be benign because it affects the lesser parts of the
body . . ." Lesser parts? It's true that I was only a black slave.
It's true Sarah Good was a beggar. So great was her poverty that
she had to abstain from coming to the meeting house for want of
clothes. It's true that Sarah Osborne had a bad reputation because
the Irish immigrant she had hired to help her on the farm quickly
advanced from the widow's barn to her bed. But even so, it was
shocking to hear us coldly described as "lesser
parts."</i></blockquote>
