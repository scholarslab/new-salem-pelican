            <h2>To Stephen Sewall NEHGR; Upham/NEHGS September 20, 1692</h2>

            <strong>September 20, 1692</strong>
             <p>My dear and very obliging Stephen,</p>
            
            
            <p> [He is beset by �objectors� to the Salem trials.] � that I may be the more capable
               to assist in lifting up a standard against the infernal enemy, I must renew my most
               importunate request, that you would please quickly to perform what you kindly
               promised, of giving me a narrative of the evidences given in at the trials of half a
               dozen or, if you please, a dozen, of the principal witches that have been condemned.
               I know, �twill cost you some time; but when you are sensible of the benefit that
               will follow, I know you will not think much of that cost. And my own willingness to
               expose myself unto the utmost, for the defense of my friends with you, makes me
               presume to plead something of merit to be considered. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p> I shall be content if you draw up the desired narrative by way of letter to me; or
               at least, let it not come without a letter, wherein you shall, if you can, intimate
               over again, what you have sometimes told me, of the awe which is upon the hearts of
               your juries, with [respect?] unto the validity of the spectral evidences. Please
               also [torn] some of your observations about the confessors and [torn] the
               credibility of what they assert; or about things evidently preternatural in the
               witchcrafts, and whatever else you may account an entertainment, for an inquisitive
               person, that entirely loves you and Salem. Nay, tho� I will never lay aside the
               character which I mentioned in my last words, yet I am willing that when you write,
               you should imagine me as obstinate a Sadducee and witch-advocate as any among us;
               address me as one that believed in nothing reasonable; and when you have so knocked
               me down, in a specter so unlike me, you will enable me to box it about among my
               neighbors, till it come, I know not where, at last. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               <em> �Sir, Your grateful friend, </em>
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>[Mentions in a postscript that Governor Phips himself prompted
               his request to Sewall.]
            </p>
