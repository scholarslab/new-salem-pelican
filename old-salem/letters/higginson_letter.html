            <p>LETTER FROM REV. JOHN HIGGINSON TO HIS SON NATHANIEL HIGGINSON,</p>
            
            
            <p>AUGUST 31, 1698.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Salem, August the 31st 1698.</p>
            
            
            <p>My Beloved Son</p>
            
            
            <p>Although my Self &amp; yr Brothr Jno. have written to you Several times Since you
               went to ye Indias Yett we know not yt Ever you Received any one from us, &amp;
               though I Question not but you have written divers Times to us Yett we have not Resd
               any one from you, Except ye first Year when you sent us yr Journal, wch I doe not
               Impute to any want of affection In yo but to some Unknown Accidents, as Intercepting
               of Lettrs &amp;c Yett I am not discoraged from writting to yo again because (if ye
               lord please) this may come to yo though never any did before, I know yo are willing
               to heare from yr Relations &amp; Native Country. In ye last lettr I Resd from yo
               befor yo wentto ye Indiaes yo Informed me that one Reason why yo left England was,
               you was willing for a time to be out of ye way of ye Troubles wch yo Saw coming upon
               Engld &amp; yt ye Same Troubles would Reach us In N: Engld wch has most sadly come
               to pase for Sr Edmund Androse being sent over from K: Jeames to be Governr here wth
               a compa of sobjects nedy prsons Lawyers &amp;c by ye Exercise of an arbitrary
               Government, ye foundation of all our Good things ware destroyd, ye wicked walked on
               Every Side &amp; ye Vilest of men ware Exalted, ye Opressions &amp; Sufferings of ye
               multitudes ware such, yt ye as Sone as they heard yt ye Prince of Orange was Gone
               for England, ye Country Rose in Armes Imprisioned ye whole Crew &amp; Sent ym for
               England, but in little more yn a year ye country was brought into a Sad condition
               being also distresed by wars from ye Indians &amp; ffrench both by land &amp; Sea
               wch continues to this day &amp; grate confusion in ye time of ye comitte of peace
               till it pleased god yt King William Gave us a new Charttr &amp; Sent Sr Wm. Phip [a]
               Native of N: England (ye last sumer) to be our Governr wherby we hope for Some
               Riviveing By degrees, but ye nessesary Grate Taxations (30 000li one year), cause
               much murmering among ye people &amp; by ye concurrance of many such causes N: Engd
               is Gratly deminshed &amp; Impoverished &amp; brought low &amp; In noe place more yn
               In Salem wch had about 60 ffishr K: &amp; othr Trading Ships belonging to it but is
               now Reduced to 15 ye whole fishr Trade bing ceased &amp; ye men Scattered &amp; Gone
               &amp; ye affliction of this time hath fallen heavely upon me &amp; my familly yt
               whearas yo know at first I had 160li p Annum but because yt was Troublesome I abattd
               4li pr Ano yt I might Recr 100li money &amp; 40 cord of wood wch I Enjoyed for many
               years till Sr Edmund Andros came yt ye way of Ratting was laid aside &amp; left to a
               Voluntary contribution wch hath proved from many nontribution it hath ben for 6
               years past but between 50 &amp; 60li p an &amp; it is not for ministers to contest a
               maintinance Especially in a time when ye people are inded Impoverished. Your brothr
               Jno is a Justice pc, Captt Horse (He is lately made Major of the Regimt) &amp; much
               used in publick Occasions through ye blesing of god one his prudence &amp; Industry
               he had attained a Competent Estate, he had five ffishr K: &amp; ptt of two othr
               Trading Ships &amp; did thrive in ye world, but by ye french taking his (&amp; othr)
               K: he is now Reduced to one K: &amp; a smal Shop he is now 44 &amp; has 5 childr yr
               Brothr Thos is now 38 a Single man &amp; yett nott in any settled way of Imployment
               haveing failed in yt he was in, I canott help him he is an object of pitty, &amp;
               Soe is Especially yr poor Sister Dolliver being at last tottally deserted by her
               unkind husband (after he had spent all yt they had or yt I could doe for him) who
               was forced Severall years agoe She and her Children to returne home to me and live
               upon me She is alas by overbaring malloncolly crazed in her undrstanding. She is 46
               an object of compassion your Sister whartons two Daughters Sarah &amp; Bethiah are
               also by ye afflicting providence of God Cast upon me. You know yr Brothr wharton was
               a ma[n] of an Excellent Spirit when he married yr Sister Sarah he had an Estate of a
               5000li &amp; in an Increasing way of marchandizeing but since his second match ye
               providence of god frowned upon him many ways he lost at once 2000li of his Trading
               Estate by ye Grate fire in Boston, &amp; a 1000li anothr time &amp; Soe yt he was
               forced to Borrow much &amp; put himself upon a designe of a coopr mine here at
               Wooburne by wch means he hoped to Recover himself, but in ye Vigerous prosicution of
               this designe at London it pleased God to take him out of this life he was much
               beloved &amp; Lamented by all yt knew him &amp; yo know he was a Good frenid of yrs.
               After his decease his Estate proved Insolvent &amp; their is not a penny left for ye
               Children they have lived Wth me divers years &amp; are upwards of twenty being
               objects of Grate compassion haveing had Liberal Education &amp; now noe postions
               &amp; I have little or nothing to Give unto ym I suppose you have heard your
               brothers Francis &amp; Henry are dead.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Concerning yr self yo have ben by ye especial providence of god seperated from ye
               Rest of yr Brothren &amp; I have been bereaved of yo this twenty years and wharas I
               intended you for ye ministrey &amp; it was a Sore affliction to me yt you was
               Diverted from it, &amp; I have thought Sometimes yt it may be God Intended you
               should be as a Joseph to preserve Relieve &amp; Supply ye nesesseties of yo fathrs
               familly &amp; yo owne flesh &amp; blood of wch also there hath been a Recent
               Excample, here in Ne England not many Years since Young Andrson of Boston getting an
               Estate at Bantam (before ye change ther) he Sent such a considerable Supply to his
               aged fathr Brothr &amp; Sisters as Enabled ym all to Live wel &amp; Comfertably,
               when they ware but in a low condition before. Ye Truth is I Cannot Wth much
               confidence Propound this to you because (though I doubt not of Josr like andrson
               like child like Affection &amp; brothrly love) I know not whether indeed yo have
               such an abillity yt you can doe as they did wthout wrong to yrself &amp; yr Imploy
               yet being latly Informed by a neighbour In Salem coming from Barbados st yt he there
               spake wh ye Captains of 2 East Indr ships [&amp;] they told him yt they knew yr self
               verry well &amp; that you was Governr of Geoges forte from if this be Indeed soe and
               yt it may be wthout any wrong whence they came &amp; yt you had a Greate Estate
               &amp; Now to your Viz yt [you] can maintain your station cary on your Trade &amp;
               Injoy ye fruits of yr owne Labour &amp; yett out of an Over plus yt God has Granted
               you wch you can spare yt which may Reach to ye Supply of ye nessesetys of yr ffathr
               family &amp; yr owne flesh &amp; blood: then Indeed I propound to you ye Scripture
               Example of Joseph &amp; ye N: Engd: Example of Anderson for yr Imitation
            </p>
            
            
            <p>You may doe it Ether by sending from where yo are, or ordering from London iff yo
               have an Estate their or may procure it to be done by ye East India Compa whome you

               &amp; tryed ffreind yr Unkle whitefeild yt will [be] Glad to be Imployed in Such a
               Service as Resring &amp; transmitting ye Same unto us I am not Ignorant of ye many
               difficulties &amp; cassualties in ye way by Reason of ye distance of time &amp;

               of God wating upon in ye way of our Duty if he will please to prosper Such a designe
