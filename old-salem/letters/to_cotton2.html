            <h2>To John Cotton Holmes/BPL October 20, 1692</h2>

            <strong>October 20, 1692</strong>
            <p>My kindest and dearest Uncle,</p>
            
            <p> [Mentions sending along a book and invites Cotton�s comments.] There are fourteen
               worthy ministers that have newly set their hands unto a book now in the press,
               containing Cases of Conscience about witchcrafts. I did, in my conscience, think
               that as the humors of this people now run, such a discourse going alone would not
               only enable our witch-advocates very learnedly to cavil and nibble at the late
               proceedings against the witches, considered in parcels, while things as they lay in
               bulk, with their whole dependences, were not exposed; but also everlastingly stifle
               any further proceedings of justice, and more than so, produce a public and open
               contest with the judges, who would (tho� beyond the intention of the worthy author
               and subscribers) find themselves brought unto the bar before the rashest Mobile. 
            </p>
            
            <p> For such cases, and for one more, I did with all the modesty I could use, decline
               setting my hand unto the book, assigning this reason: that I had already a book in
               the press which would sufficiently declare my opinion; and such a book, too, as had
               already passed the censure of the hand which wrote what was then before us. 
            </p>
            
            <p> With what sinful and raging asperity I have been since treated, I had rather forget
               than relate. Although I challenged the fiercest of my accusers to find the
               thousandth part of one wrong step taken by me in all these matters, except it were
               my use of all humble and sober endeavors to prevent such a bloody quarrel between
               Moses and Aaron as would be Bitterness in the latter end; no other fault has yet
               been laid before me. At last I have been driven to say, I will yet be more vile! and
               quoting Math V 9 I have concluded, So, I shall not want a father! 
            </p>
            
            <p> Since the trial of these unworthy treats, the persons that have used them have
               endeavored such expressions of sweetness toward me as may make me satisfaction. But
               for the great slander with which they have now filled the country against me, That I
               run against my own father and all the ministers in the country, merely because I run
               between them when they are like mad men running against one another, they can make
               me no reparation; however my God will! 
            </p>
            
            <p> [Expresses confidence that God will bless the purpose of his book] </p>
            
            <p> My friends have now happily gained a point which has been long wished for; even for
               me to become unconsidered. I confess, things become every day more and more so
               circumstanced, as if my opportunities of serving my neighbors were after a sort
               expiring; alas, that I have made no better a use of them, while I had them! I seem
               now to have little to do, but to die; and oh blessed be the free-grace of God, by
               whose help, I hope, I can do that! [Asks him to write.] God preserve you, and all
               yours, from a crafty, busy, prevailing devil. Farewell. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <em> And think on, Your honest cousin, </em>
            </p>
