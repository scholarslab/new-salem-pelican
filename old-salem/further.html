<br />
The first witchcraft accusations occurred in Salem Village, then a
parish of the town of Salem, at the end of February 1692. The
accusations began with two young girls who lived in the home of the
Rev. Samuel Parris. Prior conflicts within the village had caused
the departure of three ministers in the past sixteen years. Almost
immediately after Rev. Parris's arrival in 1689, conflicts arose
among villagers concerned about the benefits Parris was to receive,
including ownership of the parsonage. In 1692 a new Village
committee opposed to Parris was elected. Parris's salary was not
paid for months, and he began to run out of money and firewood. In
January,1692, Parris's 9 year-old daughter Betty Parris and her 12 year-old cousin
Abigail Williams began to behave erratically and exhibit extreme
physical contortions. Their actions were similar to that of the
Goodwin children in Boston who had fallen into fits and accused a
servant woman named Glover of bewitching them. Glover was later
convicted and hanged as a witch. The Goodwin case and the
children's' "afflicted" behavior were described in detail in a
widely read book, Memorable Providences, written by Rev. Cotton Mather, a prominent Boston
minister, and published in 1689.</p>
<p>In Salem Village the Rev. Parris and other local ministers were
unable to remedy the girls' behavior through prayer. Doctor William
Griggs, a village physician, was consulted, and he pronounced the
girls to be suffering from the "Evil Hand." Several young friends
of Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, also exhibited similar
behavior. They were all children of influential families in the
Village and supporters of Rev. Parris: Ann Putnam, Jr., daughter of
Sgt. Thomas Putnam, Elizabeth
Hubbard, grand niece of William Griggs, Mercy Lewis, a servant in the home of
Thomas Putnam, and Mary Walcott, daughter of Capt. Jonathan Walcott. A neighbor, Mary Sibley,
secretly resorted to a well-known magical procedure. She told
Parris's slave, John Indian, to make a witch's cake, using some of
the girls' urine, and to feed it to a dog to discover the names of
the witches afflicting them. Subsequently, the girls began to name
people in the Village. The first to be accused were easy targets of
social prejudice: Sarah Good, a
homeless mother and beggar, Tituba, the Indian slave of the Rev.
Parris; and Sarah Osburn, a woman
whose marriage and inheritance dispute attracted disfavor. Titbua,
the first to be examined by the magistrates, admitted that she had
been beaten by Rev. Parris and told to confess. She confessed
volubly and in great detail to an alliance with the Devil, and she
named Osburn and Good as witches. Sarah Good also accused Sarah
Osburn before the magistrates. Tituba's confession and Good's
confirmation Osburn's involvement convinced the ministers and
magistrates of a local conspiracy with the Devil. Bolder
accusations followed. Emboldened, the girls accused Martha Cory and
Rebecca Nurse, both respected
members of the church. At the end of March, people in nearby
Ipswich accused Rachel Clinton, an abandoned wife, who had
previously been accused of witchcraft. All were jailed on charges
of witchcraft and shackled with iron fetters.</p>
<p>The newly appointed governor Sir
William Phips returned from England in the middle of May. He
arrived with a new royal charter and was empowered to govern. With
dozens of accused witches filling the jails and with more
accusations threatening to overwhelm the local courts, Governor
Phips established a special court of Oyer and Terminer ("to hear
and determine") to try the backlog of cases. In June, the first to
be executed was Bridget Bishop, an
outspoken woman who had been accused of witchcraft twelve years
earlier. The accusations continued and began to spread outside
Salem Village, filling the jails in Salem, Boston, Cambridge, and
Ipswich. Accusations also began to spread up the social ladder to
people of high social status, such as Salem's richest merchant,
Philip English, and the famed sea
Captain John Alden. The most active accusers lived in Salem
Village, and this community suffered the most from executions,
while the people of Andover sustained the largest number of
accusations.</p>

The court of Oyer and Terminer was headed by Lieutenant Governor
William Stoughton, appointed by Governor Phips. Stoughton supported
the validity of spectral evidence used by the girls and young women
in their accusations. A "specter" was the image of a person visible
only to the witchcraft victim whom the specter was said to have
attacked in some way. The use of spectral evidence was common in
New England witchcraft trials, but never played a decisive role.
The Rev. Cotton Mather, writing
on behalf of several Boston ministers, advised caution in relying
on such evidence but at the same time urged the court to undertake
"the speedy and vigorous prosecution" of anyone guilty of
witchcraft. In the Salem, spectral evidence was used to initiate
legal complaints, alleging harmful pinching or choking, in order to
bring people into court on charges of witchcraft, with the
presumption of guilt. As the documents reveal, the magistrates were
successful in obtaining dozens of confessions of witchcraft, which
meant testifying to having made a covenant with the Devil. The
records show that 47 people confessed to witchcraft, and many did
so when it was apparent that confession would put off a trial. This
was an unprecedented exception to the law pertaining to capital
offenses. Much persuasion and some torture was used to make people
confess to a covenant with the Devil. All those who confessed were
saved, whereas those who maintained their innocence were executed.
This, again, was unprecedented legal procedure. When some
confessors recanted their false confessions, for reasons of
conscience, serious doubts about the confessions of others were
raised, and the legal process called into question.</p>
<p>In early October, the Rev
Increase Mather, minister of North Church and President of
Harvard College, together with other ministers in Boston, such as
the Rev. Samuel Willard,
prevailed upon Governor Phips to
stop the proceedings of the special court in Salem and to disallow
the use of spectral evidence. Public opinion was also changing, as
indicated in a <a href=
	"http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/BurNarr.xml">
famous letter by Thomas Brattle</a>. Without the admission of
spectral evidence and without the court room performances of the
"afflicted" girls, convictions of witchcraft soon came to an end.
In January, Phips appointed the Superior Court of Judicature to try
the backlog of cases and begin clearing the jails. In a letter of
explanation sent to England, Eventually, <a href=
	"http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/BurNarr.xml">
Phips wrote a letter of explanation</a> to the Crown saying that he
stopped the trials because "I saw many innocent persons might
otherwise perish. Phips cited his absence from Boston while
fighting Indians and the zealousness of Stoughton for allowing the
Salem trials get out of hand.</p>
<p><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p>Despite strong opposition, Samuel Parris clung to his position
as the pastor of Salem Village, admitting too late that "I may have
been mistaken." He was forced to leave the Village in 1696. In 1697
a Day of Repentance was declared in Boston. On that day Samuel Sewall, a prominent magistrate on
the court of Oyer and Terminer, rose from his seat in South Church
to confess the "blame and shame" of the witch trials in a statement
read by Rev.Samuel Willard.
Twelve jurors who also served on that court confessed to "the guilt
of innocent blood." Years later, in 1706 Ann Putnam, Jr, one of the
most active accusers, stood in her pew before the Salem Village
church while the Rev. Joseph Green read her confession of
"delusion" by the devil.</p>
<p>In 1711, the courts of Massachusetts Bay began to make monetary
restitution to the families of those who were jailed. The names of
some of those condemned and executed were cleared; and the process
of clearing names of the condemned from the court records continues
today.<br /></p>
