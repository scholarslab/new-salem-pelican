        <h3>Digitizing the Upham Map</h3>
        <h4>D. Test Digitization</h4>
        <p>We decided to scan the map at a high resolution and digitize the
        data from the image. Digitizing from paper sources is potentially
        more time-consuming and more prone to error because of human
        fatigue.</p>
        <h5>Locate Temporary TICS on Upham's Map</h5>
        <p>Once the map was scanned, we began by developing a set of
        temporary tics to anchor future work on the non-referenced data. We
        chose these tics based on their visibility on the map. When precise
        points were identified, they would be matched to existing points on
        Upham's map.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/proc5a.gif" width="598" height="428" /></p>
        <h5>Digitizing Points</h5>
        <p>Once the tics were digitized, we proceeded to trace the points,
        one-by-one. Upham used a mix of Arabic numerals, alphabetical
        characters, and other glyphs to represent the dwellings and
        landmarks on his map. To track these point features and link them
        to other information in our developing database, we assigned our
        own internal key number to each point: we followed Upham's numeric
        system at first, then continued sequentially through the
        non-alphabetical characters, then the alphabetical characters. This
        process produced 182 points.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/proc6a.gif" width="517" height="470" /></p>
        <h5>Digitizing Other Features</h5>
        <p>We also digitized major roads, streams and the boundary of Salem
        Village. Because the location and shape of even natural features
        can change over the course of 300 years, line features such as
        streams or roads will not be used to help located contemporary real
        world sites. Instead, these features are less important for the
        data they convey than for the visual reference they provide on
        Upham's map.</p>
